# COSC345-Project

## Description
- The COSC345 project is a semester long project that is built using "two or more publicly available data sets (on different topics) that can be combined to add meaning to something, and build an app that uses that combined data for the betterment of the user or society".

## Our App
- Our idea for the app is to make public information about MPs published on the parliament website easily viewable and searchable to the public. With the purpose of making people more informed about who theyâ€™re voting for especially in regards to the upcoming election. 

## Reports

## How To Run
- In the COSC345-Project Repo go to Actions
- On the left side-bar click on Windows Release then click on the latest passed workflow run
- In the Artifacts section click on the zip file to download.
- After you've downloaded the zip file you will need to extract it twice. Then when you have the full functioning folder presumably named qt-mpGui-build look for the release folder inside it and open the terminal and cd into that folder
-  then run the command ./cardTest.exe
