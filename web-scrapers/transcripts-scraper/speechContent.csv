0,Speech,Speaker," Members, I regret to inform the House of the death, on 24 July 2023, of Thomas de Vere (Pat) Hunt, who represented the electorate of Pakuranga from 1978 to 1984. During his membership of the House, he was a member of a number of select committees, including the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Labour and Education Committee, and the Public Expenditure Committee.",29/08/2023 14:01
1,a,Speaker,"I also regret to inform the House of the death, on 27 August 2023, of David Graham McGee CNZM, KC, who was Clerk of the House of Representatives from 1985 to 2007. He was the author of the first three editions of Parliamentary Practice in New Zealand and was held in high esteem throughout the Commonwealth as an expert on parliamentary procedure.",29/08/2023 14:01
2,a,Speaker,"I desire, on behalf of the House, to express our sense of the loss we have sustained and our sympathy with the relatives of the late former member and Clerk. I now ask members to stand with me and observe a period of silence as a mark of respect to their memories.",29/08/2023 14:01
3,Speech,Speaker," Members, I have been considering how to respond to allegations that, during oral questions last week, Rawiri Waititi may have breached a suppression order imposed by a court. ",29/08/2023 14:03
4,a,Speaker,"In 2009, the Privileges Committee reported to the House on the exercise of the privilege of freedom of speech by members in the context of court orders. This led to Standing Order 116 being adopted in its current form in 2011. It balances the House's privilege of free speech with the relationship between the House and the judiciary. Standing Order 116 gives the Speaker responsibility for balancing these important interests. To allow the Speaker to exercise discretion, it requires a member who intends to refer to a matter that is subject to a suppression order to give written notice to the Speaker. Mr Waititi did not give notice but then referred to a matter that apparently is suppressed by a court. I do not know whether his failure to give notice is because he chose not to or because there is no such order.",29/08/2023 14:03
5,a,Speaker,"I do not intend to inquire further into matters that may be suppressed, as my doing so may itself be inconsistent with the principle of comity. Standing Order 418(y) is clear that it is a contempt of this House to knowingly make reference to a matter suppressed by an order of a court, contrary to the Standing Orders. In this case, the difficulty is that investigating whether Mr Waititi has done so risks compounding the harm caused by the original breach by confirming the existence of a suppression order and possibly identifying the subject of it.",29/08/2023 14:03
6,a,Speaker,"So I have decided to deal with this matter in two ways. First, I will refer a general question of privilege to the Privileges Committee asking to consider how the House should deal with cases such as this, where a member may have made reference to a matter in breach of a suppression order but investigating it could be inconsistent with the order if one exists.",29/08/2023 14:03
7,a,Speaker,"Second, I intend to deal with Mr Waititi's comments as a matter of order. The words Mr Waititi used in the House indicate that he believed that the matter concerned was subject to a suppression order, and, yet, he raised it without first notifying the Speaker. Parliament's relationship with the courts is of utmost constitutional importance. Reckless use of the freedom of speech enjoyed by the House damages that relationship and undermines the standing of this Parliament and the privileges on which it depends.",29/08/2023 14:03
8,Speech,Speaker," I'm sure that members would wish to welcome members from the Malaysian Parliamentary Special Select Committee for Women, Children and Community Development, led by the Hon Hajah Rodziah binti Ismail.",29/08/2023 14:08
9,Speech,Grant Robertson," I seek leave that the House appoint the Hon Poto Williams as an Assistant Speaker until the end of Thursday, 31 August 2023, despite Standing Order 29.",29/08/2023 15:13
10,Speech,Speaker, Is there objection to that course being followed? There is none. Thank you very much.,29/08/2023 15:13
11,Speech,David Parker," I move, That the report of the Privileges Committee concerning a member's compliance with the requirements of Appendix B of the Standing Orders be noted. ",29/08/2023 15:13
12,a,David Parker,"I will, as chair of the Privileges Committee, give a summary of the report from the committee. This report relates to the failure by the Hon Mr Wood to properly declare his interests in two companies: Auckland International Airport Limited and Contact Energy. As the report shows, Mr Wood had these interests at the time he entered into Parliament, but he had acquired those shares quite a long time ago, around 1998, and he didn't declare them until 2022 and 2023. He first entered Parliament in 2017, and as the report explains—and as Mr Wood explained to the committee—he forgot that he owned those shares. He was, at one time, also confused between the shares in his personal name and shares held by a trust. But in any event, the committee found that his actions in respect of the period between 2017 and 2022 when he did declare the shares, was essentially negligent in that he was in breach of his duties to the House to make a proper disclosure of those shares. ",29/08/2023 15:13
13,a,David Parker,"There was also an allegation that shares that were owned by a trust in which he had an interest—also in Auckland International Airport—should have been disclosed. The committee went through in some detail, the—oh, no. Sorry. Before I cover that, I should note that there are a number of members who on occasions make mistakes in their returns on shares or other assets, and those mistakes are not to be taken lightly. But when a mistake is noted, it is a duty upon the member not just to fix the error going forward by making a correct disclosure in a later year, but to cause the registrar to be aware of the error or the omission in earlier returns, and to correct that error by causing the earlier returns to be corrected. And that's the mistake that Mr Wood made here: both not declaring the shares in Auckland International Airport and Contact Energy in those first five years, but then, once he did become aware that he had made those mistakes, not correcting the earlier returns—instead, he just made correct returns in the years that followed.",29/08/2023 15:13
14,a,David Parker,"The other allegation that was made against him was in respect of shares owned by the JM Fairey Family Trust, and there the committee quite carefully sets out the rules that are in Standing Orders. Those rules say that pecuniary interests that are held by a member in a company or business entity are meant to be disclosed to the extent that the rules require them to be disclosed. The rules, then, make it clear that company interests that are owned by a trust, or indeed another company, don't have to be disclosed. And that's made clear by clause 5(2) of the relevant rules, which says that ""a member does not have a pecuniary interest in a company … merely because the member has a pecuniary interest in another ….business entity""—in this case a trust—""that has a pecuniary interest in [that company]"". And it's on that issue that the Privileges Committee makes it clear that on our reading of the rules, it's actually quite clear that interests owned by a trust in a company don't currently have to be disclosed. ",29/08/2023 15:13
15,a,David Parker,"That's also made clear in the relevant form that members have to fill in, form 4, which sets out beneficial interests and trusteeships of trust, and the form says ""Do not include the pecuniary interests that the trust itself may have, e.g., the assets of the trust—the exception to which is real property held in a trust, which you should declare in form 6."" Now, the reason that there is a different rule for real property is because the Standing Orders make it clear, with a specific rule covering that, that real interests in land held by a trust do have to be disclosed, but the opposite is the case in respect of shares held by a trust. So one of the recommendations of the Privileges Committee is that if the Standing Orders Committee indeed thinks that interests of a trust in a company should be declared, then the Standing Orders should be changed to make that clear. But at the moment, the opposite is true: it is clear that they don't have to be. So to that extent, we disagreed with the reference that had been made to us by the Registrar of Pecuniary Interests, because we thought it was clear unanimously across the committee on the face of the rules that those other interests did not need to be declared, i.e., an interest of a trust in a company is not caught by the disclosure rules. ",29/08/2023 15:13
16,a,David Parker,"It remains the case, however, that the Hon Michael Wood should have disclosed the interests that he held in his personal name between 2017 and 2022, and that he didn't—and that once he became aware of that error, he shouldn't have just corrected the matter going forward, he should have corrected it looking backwards. I would also note that the committee found that this didn't amount to a contempt. It was a serious breach of the rules that the committee drew to the attention of the House, and our recommendation was that the member be required to apologise. ",29/08/2023 15:13
17,Speech,Ginny Andersen (Minister For The Digital Economy And Communications) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House," I move, That, under section 25(1) and (2) of the Parliamentary Service Act 2000 and effective on 1 November 2023, this House—replace clause 3(a) of the Parliamentary Service (Parliamentary Precincts) Resolution 2021 with the land and buildings at 147 Lambton Quay, Wellington, contained in record title WN53A/210 and leased by the Parliamentary Corporation as at the date of this resolution, comprising levels 2-6 of the building, being 3,354m² more or less, and 9 carparks in the basement of the building.",29/08/2023 16:05
18,Speech,Speaker, The question is that the motion be agreed to.,29/08/2023 16:05
19,Speech,Ginny Andersen," I move, That the House take note of the Declaration of inconsistency: Voting age in the Electoral Act 1993 and the Local Electoral Act 2001.",29/08/2023 16:05
20,a,Ginny Andersen,"We are here to debate the declaration of inconsistency relating to the voting age for both parliamentary and local elections, the Justice Committee's report on the declaration, and the Government's response to the declaration. This is the first time the House has followed the new procedures in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act for responding to a declaration of inconsistency. A declaration of inconsistency is a formal statement by a court or tribunal that an Act is inconsistent with fundamental human rights, protected by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. In November 2022, the Supreme Court issued a declaration of inconsistency, stating that the voting age as 18, set out on the Electoral Act 1993 and the Local Electoral Act 2001 is inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and the inconsistency had not been justified. The inconsistency arises because the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act sets out to be free from discrimination on the basis of age for those aged 16 and older.",29/08/2023 16:05
21,a,Ginny Andersen,"I would like to thank the Justice Committee for its report on the declaration. The committee received over 500 submissions and heard from 23 submitters. The committee recommended by majority that the Government amend the Local Electoral Act and investigate lowering the minimum voting age in general elections to 16. The majority said that the right to be free from age discrimination should only be limited by good justifications. Both the majority of the committee and the Supreme Court cited evidence provided by the Office of the Children's Commissioner in its report to the High Court. The evidence cited is that people in their mid-teens are generally able to make deliberative decisions such as voting decisions, even if their ability to make more emotionally charged decisions remains underdeveloped. The majority on the committee also discussed the potential for a younger voting age to instil life-long voting habits.",29/08/2023 16:05
22,a,Ginny Andersen,"On 14 August, the Minister of Local Government and I tabled the Government response to the declaration. After considering the declaration of inconsistency and the report produced by the Justice Committee, it is the Government's view that the inconsistency should be eliminated to the extent possible. As part of the Government response, the Minister of Local Government introduced the Electoral (Lowering Voting Age for Local Elections and Polls) Legislation Bill. This bill will lower the voting age to 16 for local elections only.",29/08/2023 16:05
23,a,Ginny Andersen,"There are strong arguments in favour of lowering the voting age: 16- and 17-year-olds are far more likely to be living at home, be connected to their community, and have a stable address than those just a few years older. New Zealand, along with the rest of the world, is facing significant issues such as climate change. Young people need to be involved in conversations about these issues and their views need to be heard, including through the ballot box.",29/08/2023 16:05
24,a,Ginny Andersen,"I know there are some concerns about whether 16- and 17-year-olds are old enough for this sort of responsibility, but let's stop and think about some of the things we already allow 16-year-olds to do. Sixteen-year-olds can be held criminally responsible for breaking the law, they can choose to leave home, they can choose where they want to live, choose to leave school, choose to refuse medical treatment, apply for a drivers licence, apply for a firearms licence, and get an adult passport, and yet we don't allow them to vote for their local councillor.",29/08/2023 16:05
25,a,Ginny Andersen,"As signalled by the Prime Minister in March of this year, the Government has decided to focus on lowering the voting age for local elections only. The bill reflects the differences between how the voting age is set out in legislation. The provisions of the Electoral Act that set the voting age at 18 for parliamentary elections can only be amended if 75 percent of members in the House agree or there is a majority in a referendum. Preparing and progressing a bill that has no prospect of being passed into law would be a costly and time consuming exercise that would not lead to any practical change. In contrast, the voting age for local government elections can be amended by a simple majority. That is why the Government has decided to focus on a bill that lowers the voting age to 16 for local elections only. I hope that members will take a rights and evidence - based approach to the future debate on this bill. We stand here as representatives of all our constituents, not just the ones that are eligible to vote for us.",29/08/2023 16:05
26,a,Ginny Andersen,"Lastly, I would like to acknowledge Make It 16, the advocacy group that initiated this case in the courts and the many other groups and individuals who have been calling on the voting age to be lowered for some time. The advocacy by youth on this issue shows that young people can lead important conversations about the changes that directly impact upon them and I commend them for this work.",29/08/2023 16:05
27,Speech,Deputy Speaker, The question is that the motion be agreed to.,29/08/2023 16:12
28,Speech,Assistant Speaker," Members, the result of the vote on the question that the House take note of the Declaration of inconsistency: Voting age in the Electoral Act 1993 and the Local Electoral Act 2001 was incorrectly recorded as Ayes 96, Noes, 10. The correct result is Ayes 106, Noes 10.",29/08/2023 19:30
29,Speech,Deputy Speaker," Just before we go into the next bill, members, when the House was in committee on the Fuel Industry (Improving Fuel Resilience) Amendment Bill, the result of the vote on the question that the question be now put was incorrectly reported as Ayes 71, Noes 44. The correct result is Ayes 72, Noes 44. The record will be corrected accordingly.",24/08/2023 11:56
30,Speech,Tim Van De Molen," Point of order, Mr Speaker. I seek leave to make a personal statement. ",24/08/2023 14:00
31,Speech,Speaker, Leave is sought for that purpose. Is there any objection? There appears to be none.,24/08/2023 14:00
32,ContinueSpeech,Tim Van De Molen," Thank you, Mr Speaker. Today, the Privileges Committee has presented its report into the question of privilege concerning my conduct towards the chairperson of the Transport and Infrastructure Committee. The Privileges Committee has found my actions to be a contempt of Parliament, and when Parliament sits next week, I will be censured.",24/08/2023 14:00
33,a,Speaker,"Members of Parliament and parliamentary staff should be able to carry out their duties in a stable environment. The report from the Privileges Committee makes it clear that my conduct after the select committee on 29 June had an impact on others that I had not appreciated. Although I have a different recollection of some aspects of the incident, I completely accept the findings of the committee. I apologise to all those who were in the room but specifically to Mr Halbert, who was most impacted by my conduct. I am horrified at the thought of my conduct having been perceived as threatening. This is not at all in my nature, and I've enjoyed working constructively with MPs from across the House. Obviously, in this instance, I have fallen short of my own expectations and the expectations of the House. ",24/08/2023 14:00
34,a,Speaker,"No one should feel threatened in their workplace, and it was certainly not my intent to threaten Mr Halbert. Regardless, my conduct was not appropriate, and it should not have happened. I would also like to apologise specifically to the select committee staff, who do a wonderful job for us all. I'd like to thank the many MPs that have offered their support through this process. And, finally, I would also like to extend an apology to all members of this House for the impact my actions may have on the perception of parliamentarians and of this House. ",24/08/2023 14:00
35,Speech,Michael Wood, I seek leave to make a personal statement.,23/08/2023 14:58

37,ContinueSpeech,Michael Wood, The Privileges Committee has tabled its report into my compliance with the requirements of Appendix B of the Standing Orders. I thank the committee for their work on this issue.,23/08/2023 14:58
38,a,Michael Wood,"Their report confirms that I should have declared the shares I personally owned in the 2017 to 2021 period, and that I should have corrected the register of pecuniary interests after I did correctly declare them in 2022 and 2023. I have previously acknowledged this and I would now like to take the opportunity to unreservedly apologise to the House. As the committee notes, this was an error on my part and I deeply regret it. I've learnt a clear lesson: in an intense and all-consuming job I lost sight of the importance of these matters and I will prioritise complete compliance in this area as I continue my work in the Parliament. ",23/08/2023 14:58
39,a,Michael Wood,"Again, I thank the Privileges Committee for their considered report on this matter; it points to a number of areas which I believe will be useful to all members. I also take this opportunity to thank a number of members from across the House who have been supportive of me in what has been a challenging issue to deal with.",23/08/2023 14:58
40,Speech,Michael Woodhouse," Point of order, Mr Speaker. Thank you, Mr Speaker. I've been made aware of an error in the vote on the Taxation Principles Reporting Bill second reading, where the National Party opposed the amendments recommended by the Finance and Expenditure Committee but the motion that the bill be read a second time was passed on the voices. I seek leave for the vote to be recorded for National as 30 votes opposed on the substantive motion.",17/08/2023 11:14

42,Speech,Shanan Halbert, Just objection—speaking to that point of order. My understanding is that we would need—,17/08/2023 11:15

45,Interjection,Deputy Speaker, There is objection.,17/08/2023 11:15
46,Speech,Michael Woodhouse," Point of order. I think the member, Mr Halbert, was going to inform the House that a correction of the record in this way is not possible. But actually, the House is the architect of its own destiny, and I think the way in which you put the leave was much better than I had sought it, which was to simply hold a party vote. That's still within the prerogative of the House, and I just want to make sure that Mr Halbert is aware of that before declining leave.",17/08/2023 11:15

50,Speech,Camilla Belich," Point of order. Unfortunately, I wasn't in the House when the points of order around this first occurred, but my understanding is that my colleague was clarifying to you, Mr Speaker, that because the bill has been decided, a vote can't be taken but an option might be to record the other parties' opposition within the journals. I'm advised that that's the appropriate way—because the vote has been decided—that this should be dealt with.",17/08/2023 11:16
51,Speech,Deputy Speaker," I'll just take some advice on that. Just in relation to the point of order, I'm advised that that is not an option because there was no party vote. However, since there seems to be a desire to see a way through this, what I'll do is I'll ask the Hon Michael Woodhouse to put that request again.",17/08/2023 11:17

62,Speech,Speaker," Members, I have received a letter from Erica Stanford seeking to debate, under Standing Order 399, a recent case of migrant exploitation that was reported last night in Auckland. An urgent debate is a way of holding the Government accountable for an action for which it is responsible—Speaker's ruling 200/4.

Particular thanks to Jason McHerron, the barrister who provided advice and substantial assistance in drafting the report. Finally, I'd like to thank the clerk and the officials and advisers of the Regulations Review Committee. We lean very heavily upon them and we are routinely impressed with their diligence and their expertise. We are fortunate to have them.",3/08/2023 14:49
76,a,Judith Collins,"We would also like to—well, I would certainly like to—acknowledge that this was a very painful time for many people in New Zealand.

This is time for us to bring people back together, and I believe that the role of the Regulations Review Committee in our report is something that will give people heart.",3/08/2023 14:49
77,a,Judith Collins,"The role of the committee is that we do not review policy, but we do look at the secondary legislation and to see if it is made in accordance with its empowering provision and consistently within constitutional principles. Therefore, it is a very serious report and it is a report that I consider is actually one of the more important reports that we're going to see on COVID-19, bearing in mind we also have a royal commission as well—so put that to one side.",3/08/2023 14:49
78,a,Judith Collins,"So when looking at this, I think one of the things that impressed me the most was how poorly some Government ministries and departments actually took the role of providing good secondary legislation, and then complying with the constitutional arrangements, seriously. Now, I understand and I think we can all acknowledge that, in many cases, the Ministry of Health, the main agency in this, was under an extreme amount of stress; that they were dealing with a situation that they had not seen before—certainly not in the lifetimes of the Director-General or others—and that they were rushing.",3/08/2023 14:49
79,a,Judith Collins,"The problem—and I'm sure that members, when they wish to read the report, will understand—is that if the secondary legislation is being drafted by ministries themselves rather than Parliamentary Counsel Office, there is often not the expertise in the ministry to be able to draft clearly and within the rules that are expected of legal drafting. That was really clear.",3/08/2023 14:49
80,a,Judith Collins,"It was also clear that things seemed to not get better but worse as matters went on. When I think to the criticism of the COVID-19 Response (Vaccinations) Legislation Act—which was actually introduced on 23 November 2021 and had its first, second, and third readings on the same day—that bill received Royal assent two days later on 25 November, and that was actually really almost two years after the full first brunt of the pandemic had hit us. That bill did not go to a select committee. It did not go to the Regulations Review Committee. It was not given the sort of scrutiny that people should expect. I think it would be wrong to say that there was urgency. It was very unfortunate that this happened.",3/08/2023 14:49
81,a,Judith Collins,"When we look at—commonly known as—the traffic light system that was introduced, it could have taken another week or two or three, or even a month to bring that in. It's not as though we suddenly found in November 2021 that there was a pandemic. We're actually near the end of the worst part of it, and I think many people in this House, like myself, have had COVID a few times because, actually, the virus has moved on. It has become more transmittable and less harmful for many people.",3/08/2023 14:49
82,a,Judith Collins,"The Attorney-General, the Government's own Attorney-General—or Parliament's Attorney-General—criticised it at the time by saying it should have been sent to a select committee. He was right, it should have been. It wasn't. Instead, what we see in that legislation is that it actually referred to—and the regulations coming from it—referred to all sorts of terms that are unknown at law. Terms like ""guidance""—that's not a legal term. Terms like ""traffic lights"". Well, traffic lights are known at law as ""traffic lights"". It was legislation that might have been drafted by the communications team. It was simply not up to scratch, and nor were the regulations from it.",3/08/2023 14:49
83,a,Judith Collins,"It would have been better, and that's really clear from the review in the inquiry—and I have to say, too, we take a very non-political approach in this: not apolitical, non-political; we work across parties. It would have been much better if people who knew how to draft legislation were drafting it—whether it's that particular Act or if it's the regulations coming from it. It would have been better if it was less focused on communications rather than actually on the law, because there were instances where people could have been imprisoned under this legislation and the regulations without very clear guidance from the legislation. In other words, very clear words.",3/08/2023 14:49
84,a,Judith Collins,"In addition to that, we have made some pretty strong statements about the quality of drafting by the Ministry of Health. That is what's happened: we've, over the years, enabled ministries and departments to draft their own regulations for legislation that this Parliament has passed. There's a big problem with that, apart from the quality of drafting. That big problem is, where does one find it? Because what tends to happen is it's put on the website of that ministry or that department—or not; it might not be put there. Or if it is, it might be unclear. It might have been put up because the people who put up or load up upload the information to the website are not necessarily people who understand constitutional law or even the necessity of having it there.  Constitutional lawyers are not normally marketers, comms people, or people who know about those sorts of things. They tend to take things quite seriously for a reason.",3/08/2023 14:49
85,a,Judith Collins,"Then we have, as opposed to that, Parliamentary Counsel Office drafting where its regulations are put on the Legislation website. I would suggest that that is a good idea: that all regulations—all secondary legislation—where people can be subjected to rules should be in one place. We already have a website; we already have a place. It's called legislation.govt.nz. It is freely available to everybody. That's where it should be, in my opinion, and I think that the committee would be of that view. Because that is one place you should go.",3/08/2023 14:49
86,a,Judith Collins,"We should not have to have people wondering what the law is as they're being arrested for breaching it. We know that ignorance of the law is no excuse at law. But if you can't even find the legislation—the law—that you're accused of having breached, how could you possibly be found guilty under it? The answer is, I think we're quite lucky not to have had more court cases on this. Because, frankly, I think if we were not in a pandemic situation, there would have been more cases on this. If the cost of actually bringing cases wasn't so expensive, we would have had more cases.",3/08/2023 14:49
87,a,Judith Collins,"So there's some things that we need to do and we've seen reviews in this. This review has been ongoing, really, for quite some time. But bring ourselves back to this. We should not have regulation without people knowing what it is. Regulation should not be made willy-nilly of whether or not they're authorised by the primary legislation.",3/08/2023 14:49
88,a,Judith Collins,"It has to follow a format, and there's a reason. It's not because we're being pernif—I can't even say it now—it's not because we're being difficult about it. It's actually because this matters. Law matters. Parliament matters. We cannot simply continue down a path of ministries and departments deciding they'll have the law that they'd quite like, and that's really going to spin well. Come back to the law. Thank you.",3/08/2023 14:49

There are differing accounts of what occurred at the conclusion of the committee's meeting. If the allegations are accurate, the conduct complained of could amount to threatening or intimidating a member acting in the discharge of their duty, or threatening a member on account of their conduct in Parliament. The Speaker's role in such matters is to determine whether the facts alleged could, if true, amount to a breach of privilege or contempt of the House. The Speaker does not enquire into the veracity of the evidence presented, or conduct in inquiring into the allegation. That is the role of the Privileges Committee. I find that a question of privilege arises, and that question stands referred to the Privileges Committee. ",1/08/2023 14:01

111,a,David Parker,The Privileges Committee report on this issue has been presented to the House and is on the floor for members to see. Those who read it will see that the Privileges Committee found that the complaint in respect of disclosure of the outcome of a vote taken during the Environment Committee's consideration of a bill was upheld. I'll go through a bit more of the detail in a second.,29/03/2023 14:47
112,a,David Parker,"The committee also, whilst not wanting to minimise the transgression, didn't think that the matter was so serious as to warrant a widespread debate in the House, and so recommended to the Business Committee that we didn't think a debate was necessary. The Business Committee said findings of the Privileges Committee are always important and ought to be brought to the attention of all members so that we avoid those sorts of errors being repeated in the future, and then requested that I, as the chair of the Privileges Committee, take a single call on the matter in order to describe the events that we reported to the House upon.",29/03/2023 14:47
113,a,David Parker,"The Speaker made a reference to the Privileges Committee as a consequence of a complaint from the Hon Eugenie Sage to the Speaker about Simon Court having released the outcome of a vote during the consideration by the select committee of an item of business before them, which was the consideration of the Natural and Built Environment Bill. There was a closed session, and during the session the member formally proposed that a definition of a term be inserted into the bill. That motion was voted down, and then the member, by press release, disclosed that.",29/03/2023 14:47
114,a,David Parker,"The matter was initially referred to the Speaker by the Hon Eugenie Sage. She also said she was going to try and sort it out at select committee at a subsequent meeting. She tried to; the member didn't back down or apologise and stuck to his guns, and therefore the Hon Eugenie Sage wrote another letter of complaint to the Speaker and the Speaker referred it to the Privileges Committee.",29/03/2023 14:47
115,a,David Parker,"The Privileges Committee found it an easy matter to deal with because there was prior guidance from both earlier Privileges Committees hearings but also from a consideration of Standing Orders that had been conducted by the Standing Orders Committee in 2003. It was clear that Standing Order 243 applies, which says that ""The proceedings of a select committee or a subcommittee other than during the hearing of evidence are not open to the public and remain strictly confidential to the committee until it reports to the House.""",29/03/2023 14:47
116,a,David Parker,"The matter really was as simple as it sounds, although there is the occasional clarification of that in the 2003 report of the Standing Orders Committee. For example, if there is a proposal to change the chair or deputy chair of a select committee, that business is, effectively, concluded by the passing of the motion and therefore can be disclosed. But if there is continuing business before the select committee, then that is part of the confidential proceedings that ought not to be disclosed until the committee reports back to the House.",29/03/2023 14:47
117,a,David Parker,"The reasons for this were set out in the Standing Orders Committee report in 2003, and, in summary, select committees are required to inform the House first of their findings—and it's for the select committee to do that, not for individual members of the committee. Secondly, the ability to discuss issues in confidence promotes constructive dialogue between committee members about legislation and other parliamentary business. We are a unicameral legislature. We are reliant upon select committees doing their best to improve legislation before it, and one of the good things about our select committee model is that, generally, members from all parties cooperate to try and improve legislation at select committee even if they don't agree with it. So we've got to encourage that habit, and that is undermined if individual members of select committee, for reasons of political advantage, can whip out of the select committee and breach the confidentiality. Closed sessions enable the provision of free and frank advice to the committee—that includes from officials—and premature or selective release of committee proceedings increases the risks of lobbying outside normal processes or giving advantage to particular groups or persons.",29/03/2023 14:47
118,a,David Parker,"The committee in recent weeks has endorsed those views, found that these considerations remain of the utmost importance today and any breach undermines the integrity of select committee processes. So the findings of the committee were to concur with the Speaker's assessment of the member's actions. We found that the member's starting point should've been to be aware of the Standing Order. If the member Simon Court was unaware of it or unclear, he should've approached the clerk of the committee. When the matter was raised with him by the Hon Eugenie Sage, he should at that stage have read the Standing Order or consulted with the Clerk of the House or the clerk of the standing committee. We noted that it's the sole responsibility of each member to exercise caution in their public statements and ensure that the important rules against inappropriate and unauthorised disclosure of select committee proceedings are observed.",29/03/2023 14:47
119,a,David Parker,"In conclusion, the committee noted that the member has apologised for the matter and did not recommend any further action. We were grateful to the Speaker for having referred the question of privileges to us and emphasise that it's a timely opportunity to reinforce to all members the expectations that apply to the confidentiality of select committee proceedings and the reasons that they exist.",29/03/2023 14:47

I want to clarify that dental grants, which have historically only been available for emergency care, now also cover all immediate and essential dental care.

This is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. Not every ministerial resignation warrants an urgent debate, however debates have generally been allowed where the actions of a Minister have raised questions of probity. Therefore, I call on David Seymour to move that the House take note of a matter of urgent public importance.",25/07/2023 14:59
132,Speech,David Seymour," Thank you, Mr Speaker. I move, That the House take note of a matter of urgent public importance.",25/07/2023 14:59
133,a,David Seymour,"This resignation signifies a very human tragedy wrapped up in a Government in disarray. The events surrounding Kiri Allan's resignation are sad. She is a person who I think most members would agree was someone of great talent and promise, and yet something that few of us understand has gone wrong and led to these tragic events. It is critical that the public understands what has happened because for the probity of Ministers, and ultimately the respect of the public on this House, it's just not acceptable to have a Minister of the Crown who is breaking multiple laws on one night—who is driving while over the limit, or at least the infringement offence limit for alcohol consumption, and who has resisted arrest while serving as the Minister of Justice. Those are things that, despite the clear human tragedy at the centre of this resignation, the people deserve an explanation for in order to uphold the probity of ministerial warrants and this House. It is also absolutely critical that people understand the circumstances in which this person was put into this tragic position, because while it is a human tragedy it is also the case that it comes after a cascade of missteps and administrative bungles by this Government that are accumulating—along with the costs and the frustration faced by New Zealanders who put their trust in this Government. ",25/07/2023 14:59
134,a,David Seymour,"We now have a Government that has no more gas left in the tank. It can't even field a full Cabinet. The fact that Kiri Allan will not be replaced in Cabinet raises questions over whether or not this Labour Party has the talent to field a full team, and whether or not she felt pressure to remain on the field because they simply did not have any subs on the bench capable of doing the job. It has led to one person holding the justice portfolio and the police portfolio. That is a real problem for New Zealand or any democratic nation, because the Minister of Justice is accountable for upholding those parts of the apparatus of State that uphold, in turn, the rule of law. The Minister of Police is responsible for advocating for the police who have to be restrained by that same rule of law. When a person is put in both positions, that creates a conflict of interest. And, unfortunately, conflicts of interest have led to much of the difficulty that this Government has.",25/07/2023 14:59
135,a,David Seymour,"It might have been possible to find someone to replace Kiri Allan as the justice Minister from within the Cabinet. An obvious choice would be somebody in the form of the Attorney-General, who is a lawyer. Perhaps that person could have helped. However, unfortunately, it was found that he was already busy with other jobs. Or perhaps he just doesn't want any job, but doesn't even want to be the Minister of Revenue. Perhaps if it wasn't for the Natural and Built Environment Bill, he would be off completely.",25/07/2023 14:59
136,a,David Seymour,"You see, since the Prime Minister said she had ""no gas in the tank"" back in January, there have been a total of five ministerial departures or resignations in just seven months. First, there was our Prime Minister—which we can come back to—then there was Stuart Nash, who was found to be leaking information to donors in breach of Cabinet confidentiality. And then there was Meka Whaitiri, who was planning to jump ship to another political party and the Prime Minister knew nothing about it. And then there was Michael Wood, the guy who had a conflict of interest with his ministerial portfolios that he failed to declare—and when asked not once, not twice, but over a dozen times to resolve that conflict of interest, he didn't do it. So Michael Wood is gone. And now, sadly, we see the departure of Kiritapu Allan.",25/07/2023 14:59
137,a,David Seymour,"This is a Government that simply cannot hold it together. And people are right to ask: how can a Government so incapable of managing itself be asked to manage the many problems that New Zealanders face, with the inflation that ravages the cost of living, the lawlessness that ravages our streets. It was astonishing, just a moment ago we had what's called a ""patsy question"": a backbench Labour MP asking the Minister of Justice—or was it the Minister of Police? I think it was Justice; it's hard to know—what is being done about gangs.

142,ContinueSpeech,David Seymour," Thank you, Mr Speaker. The resignation of Kiritapu Allan has occurred in a context. It's occurred in a context of the management of people. It has occurred in a context where a person facing serious challenges was asked to work at full tilt. Having been under question for the challenges that she was personally facing, she was returned to work where she carried out a heavy schedule of announcements in the run up to an election, which amounted to reversing the positions that she, as a Minister in her Government, had been required to uphold for years as a Government and for years, in her case, as a Minister. That could only reflect back on the nature of the Government, the culture that had been imbued in it, and the leadership that it had. We cannot escape the fact that this tragic sequence of events is inextricably linked to the context of that workplace.",25/07/2023 14:59
143,a,David Seymour,"We cannot avoid the fact that we have had a Government that for a long time has sought to make policy based on the hope that if only they announce that many houses would be built, it would happen. When you have a Government that constantly tries to ensure that things will happen simply by wishing it so, the frustration that amounts, the problems that arise in the public domain, the pressure that comes back on to Ministers as a result. Well, unfortunately, all of those things which fully reflect upon the Government have been contributing factors to this particular tragic sequence of events. The Government has lost a Minister in highly questionable circumstances that bring into question ministerial probity—not just because of that individual's choices, which are clearly wrong and for which she has apologised, lost her job, and moved on. But they have occurred in the context of a Government that is failing at multiple levels and cannot be a good place for a Minister to be, where there is not a replacement to come on—all of these things, Mr Speaker.",25/07/2023 14:59
144,a,David Seymour,"I can understand why the Minister of Finance doesn't want to hear them, but, nevertheless, they remain true. They are the true context in which these events occurred. It is simply the case that what we find ourselves with now as New Zealanders is a Government that can at best be described as a caretaker Government: one that cannot field a full team, one that cannot manage itself—let alone the challenges of inflation, of lawlessness, and of division that have grown up like mushrooms under this Government. Failing and lacking the ability to manage itself or any of the problems that New Zealanders face, this Government will now amble towards October 14, and at that time people facing these problems—this inflation, this lawlessness, and this division—will have to ask themselves: are they not better with a new team? Is it not possible that New Zealanders can hope to see a Government focused not on itself and its multiple losses of personnel, but instead focused on their problems and on solving them with practical solutions that aren't satisfied simply with sounding good, but actually work? That is the challenge that is now before New Zealanders. That is what this unfortunate sequence of events has brought about, and that is the arena into which ACT enters to provide a better solution, a better way forward, and one that is not going to be so tragically negligent of people that come to serve in the Government.",25/07/2023 14:59
145,a,David Seymour,"I finish by giving my best wishes and regards to Kiritapu Allan at a personal level. She is a person that I have known and interacted with over the years and found to be a good person, a person of great intelligence and capability. She has chosen a course, and I respect, obviously, and would like to support from afar that choice that she makes. We wish her all of the best and we hope that all people who come here to do the job can find themselves in a circumstance where they can make a difference as part of a strong team that is responsive to the problems and challenges New Zealand face and put in place coherent solutions that actually solve those problems. Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.",25/07/2023 14:59
146,Speech,Carmel Sepuloni, I wish to make a ministerial statement relating to the serious incident that unfolded in Auckland this morning. ,20/07/2023 14:01
147,a,Carmel Sepuloni,"This morning, at 7.23 a.m., the morning commute in Tāmaki-makau-rau Auckland came to a halt. A serious incident unfolded after reports of a person discharging a firearm inside a site on lower Queen Street. Two people have died and also the male offender is deceased. Police have confirmed an officer has been injured as well as five members of the public at this stage. The police officer was transported to hospital in a critical condition, but his condition has stabilised. The four members of the public have injuries ranging from moderate to critical. ",20/07/2023 14:01
148,a,Carmel Sepuloni,"I can advise the House that this is not a national security risk, and police are now commencing an investigation into what has occurred. Within three minutes of the incident being reported, the New Zealand Police Eagle was en route. At 7.34 a.m., police had arrived on the scene and the armed offenders squad was there by 7.38 a.m. I really want to thank the first responders—New Zealand Police, the armed offenders squad, and St John Ambulance—for acting and responding as swiftly as they did this morning.",20/07/2023 14:01
149,a,Carmel Sepuloni,"Aucklanders were on their way to work. Aucklanders were at work. In a country like our own, this is the last thing you would expect to encounter on your morning commute or whilst doing your job. But the rapid response from our first responders meant they could move at pace to protect as many people as possible.",20/07/2023 14:01
150,a,Carmel Sepuloni,"I want to reiterate that this appears to be the actions of one individual and there is no wider national security threat, nor are police seeking anybody else in relation to the incident. It's also important that we acknowledge the number of people we have visiting New Zealand and staying in Auckland currently for the FIFA Women's World Cup. This event has not been impacted and will proceed as planned.",20/07/2023 14:01

152,a,Carmel Sepuloni,"To the loved ones and whānau of the victims, I know that words cannot heal trauma, but I want you to know that there is much strength to be drawn from solidarity and community, something that we as Aucklanders and New Zealanders offer up in spades. You are not alone in this grieving process and nor should you be. Kia kaha, kia māia, kia manawanui.",20/07/2023 14:01

The final date that the data was released was determined by Te Whatu Ora based on when the information was ready.",19/07/2023 17:45

165,Speech,Speaker, The registrar has determined that the matter under inquiry involves a question of privilege. The question therefore stands referred to the Privileges Committee. ,18/07/2023 14:03
166,Speech,Speaker," Members, I have received a letter from Karen Chhour seeking to debate under Standing Order 399 reports of mixed martial arts - style fighting at an Oranga Tamariki youth justice residence. ""An urgent debate is a way of holding the Government accountable for an action for which it is responsible.""—Speakers' Ruling 200/4. The Government's response to this matter and other reports about abuse in Oranga Tamariki facilities has been to appoint a former Police Commissioner to lead a review into youth justice facilities. That response was debated on 21 June. I'm not convinced that there have been further developments in the Government's response that warrant an additional debate at this point. The application is therefore declined.",18/07/2023 14:59
167,Speech,David Parker," I move, That the report of the Privileges Committee concerning the time taken by the Minister of Education to correct a misleading statement to the House be noted. ",18/07/2023 15:00
168,a,David Parker,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. May I begin by making a more general reference. I've been in this House now for 20 years, and in the period prior to your assuming the Chair, I've been Privileges Committee chair for quite a while—and I served on the prior committees for a while. In my opinion, there have been too few references to the Privileges Committee, so I'm pleased that you, as Speaker, are taking your responsibilities seriously to make sure that the Standing Orders are adhered to. That doesn't mean to say that all references to the Privileges Committee are of the same standing, and I'm not denying the seriousness of this reference, but I do think it's good that the reputation of this Parliament is maintained. And one of the ways that we maintain the reputation of this Parliament and the confidence of people in this Parliament is by upholding the Standing Orders.",18/07/2023 15:00
169,a,David Parker,"In respect of the reference to the committee on 30 May, the Speaker said that a matter of privilege had been raised by him, alleging that the ""Hon Jan Tinetti deliberately misled the House by failing to correct a misleading statement at the earliest opportunity."" The Speaker noted that ""In a supplementary question on 22 February 2023, the Minister was asked to categorically state that she had played no part in the delay of release of school attendance information. The Minister replied that she already had, and that it was a decision for the Ministry of Education. The Minister corrected this answer on 2 May, stating 'I subsequently became aware that my office did have input into the timing of the release of the data through email correspondence with officials at the Ministry of Education.'"" ",18/07/2023 15:00
170,a,David Parker,"Returning to the Speaker's reference: ""The Minister has stated that she was informed by her staff after question time on 22 February of her staff's correspondence with the Ministry on the release of data. She also stated that she did not know her answer needed to be corrected until she received a letter from [the Speaker] on 1 May, after which she corrected it."" The Speaker has said, ""It is an important principle that the House can trust the accuracy of ministerial replies to parliamentary questions. While mistakes are sometimes made which can result in the House receiving an answer containing a misleading statement, it is vitally important that as soon as this is discovered, the Minister returns to the House to correct their answer at the earliest opportunity"", and accordingly, the Speaker said, ""I have considered the matter raised and considered its degree of importance"", and then said it was for the Privileges Committee to determine whether delaying correcting the incorrect statement amounted to a contempt and referred it to the select committee. ",18/07/2023 15:00
171,a,David Parker,"The select committee then heard evidence from the Minister; that evidence was, in the main, heard in public session. All of the oral evidence from the Hon Jan Tinetti was heard, as all privileges complaints are, in open session, and the media were in attendance. We heard from the Minister for an hour. There were follow-up questions that were put by the committee, at the request of members of the committee, to clarify some of the answers that had been given by the Hon Jan Tinetti. One of those issues that the committee was interested to inquire further into was whether in fact she was rushed after question time—when she had given her incorrect answer and when she first learned, after returning to her office, that her office had been engaged with the Ministry as to the date for the release of the information. What happened on the day was that, at the end of question time, the Minister was on duty, and after her period of duty, she returned to her office and she spoke with two staff briefly. She was informed that her answer was incorrect and that her office had been involved. One of the pieces of advice she had from a staff member was that that meant she had an answer that she needed to correct, and then the other person thought that because she thought the answer was correct when she gave it, she didn't need to correct the answer, because it wasn't misleading; because it was correct—as she believed the matters to be when she gave it. There was then a period of delay when the Minister did nothing to update the House as to her learning that her answer had been incorrect. She then travelled overseas for a period.",18/07/2023 15:00
172,a,David Parker,"There was a letter in respect of an earlier complaint by a member to the Speaker where the Speaker wrote to the Minister and said, ""Are you sure you don't need to correct this?"" And the Minister replied, ""No, I stand by my statement at the time."" And again, the Minister, in her evidence to us, defended that statement on the basis that she said that her understanding was that because she believed her answer to be correct at the time she gave it, it wasn't misleading because that's what she believed to be the truth when she gave it. Unfortunately for the Minister, that's actually not a correct application of the Standing Orders, because it's not whether we believe the information to be correct, it's actually whether it was, and as soon as the Minister learned that the information was incorrect, the Minister should have immediately, at the first opportunity, returned to the House and made that correction. ",18/07/2023 15:00
173,a,David Parker,"The next decision that we had to take as a committee—having essentially found those facts, as I have summarised them, I hope, fairly—was ""How serious is this, and is it serious enough to amount to a contempt?"" As you'll see, the report of the committee was unanimous: we are quite critical of the Minister; we have found her actions to have been negligent. The Minister could have sought advice from the Clerk of the House, from senior colleagues—in a number of ways, she could have sought further information to clarify her position—which, in the view of the committee, as soon as she had that information when she returned to her office, at least gave her pause for thought to actually take an active step to resolve the issue. Instead, the Minister didn't, and as a consequence of that, the committee unanimously found that the Minister—I think we used the word ""should""—should be criticised and be subject to the criticism of the House for that error. Whilst by that time the Minister had corrected her answer in the House, she hadn't apologised to the House.",18/07/2023 15:00
174,a,David Parker,"Where the committee determined the issue as to whether the behaviour of the member was a contempt—as opposed to something that wasn't a contempt but still worthy of criticism from my perspective; and other members can speak for themselves—that essentially turns upon whether this was deliberate or not. It was sloppy, it was wrong, but it wasn't deliberate. Upon that basis, looking at precedents from earlier Privileges Committees, where earlier instances of the House being misled had been considered by Privileges Committees, the committee, in the end, determined that it wasn't necessary to find the Hon Jan Tinetti in contempt of the House, but it was appropriate that she apologises to the House, which she has since done. ",18/07/2023 15:00
175,a,David Parker,"Can I thank the members of the committee for the work that they did. I thought that we handled the issue appropriately. I think it is a salutary lesson to Ministers—and to members generally—that the Standing Orders need to be adhered to if this place is to work properly, and amongst the most important of those functions is the holding of the Government to account; the Government that spends money and has authority on behalf of the people to do very serious things. One of the most important ways in which Governments are held to account is through question time, and therefore, when a question is wrong and misleads the House, it ought to be corrected at the earliest possible opportunity.",18/07/2023 15:00

184,a,Grant Robertson,"I'd also like to recognise that the team's achievements extend beyond the incredible medal count. Our athletes have been smashing personal bests, learning more about just what they are capable of, and developing lifelong friendships and bonds along the way. Athletes representing Aotearoa New Zealand for the games are chosen for both their sporting ability and their resilience. As the games were hosted in Berlin, attending has meant undertaking the longest journey many of our athletes have ever made, while being away from their family and loved ones for three weeks. This trip to Berlin has been truly life changing for many of these athletes and support staff. I applaud our athletes for taking on the challenge of participating in this event and for demonstrating the true sense of being a team. They have strengthened their bonds together, supported one another through the excitement of attending the event, and attaining individual success while also supporting each other through any disappointments. These athletes are truly inspirational, showing us what it means to be thrown out of your comfort zone on the other side of the world and to come out on the other side stronger together, having gained new skills and developed confidence and greater independence.",28/06/2023 14:00
185,a,Grant Robertson,"There are so many highlights I hesitate to mention them, but I will acknowledge a few. Footballer Cole Bailey, who scored Aotearoa New Zealand's first ever goal at a Special Olympics World Summer Games; ten-pin bowler Len Just, who was the oldest athlete in the contingent—I won't say how old—winning gold and two bronze medals; powerlifter Lynett Williams achieving her dream of winning a gold medal, then winning three more medals, two silvers and a bronze; and bocce player Aaron Campbell from the mighty Ōtaki electorate enjoying two personal bests, winning New Zealand's first Special Olympics gold medal and travelling overseas for the first time in his life.",28/06/2023 14:00

On behalf of the Government, I say again: congratulations. We all welcome you home to Aotearoa New Zealand and encourage you to continue to strive for your best, have fun along the way. You have been an inspiration to all of us in showing what determination, resilience, and teamwork can achieve. Each of our athletes has embodied the Special Olympics oath: ""Let me win.

Mr Court admitted making the press release informing the media of the outcome of a vote taken during the committee's consideration.

If there is any doubt, they should seek clarification in the committee or discuss with committee staff whether disclosure is permissible. The confidentiality attached to committee proceedings apart from public evidence was relaxed in 2003 to enable members to disclose procedural decisions such as the appointment of advisers or a decision not to initiate an inquiry. Because these procedural matters do not reflect the potential findings of a committee or indicate the direction of its consideration, there is no difficulty in divulging them before the committee reports to the House. However, discussion and voting on substantive matters before the committee remain strictly confidential until the committee reports to the House.",20/06/2023 14:01

234,Speech,Speaker," Members, following a point of order from the Leader of the House, I've decided to make the following ruling. It is both the longstanding practice of this House and exceedingly common for members to use excerpts in questions—Speakers' ruling 177/7. Standing Order 390 explicitly states that questions must be concise, which means quotations of any great length will be ruled out of order. Members asking questions may choose which part of a Minister's statement to quote, as long as they do so accurately, can authenticate it, and do not misrepresent the statement—for example, by failing to include the word ""not"" or similar. If words are missed from the middle of a quote, an ellipsis must be used—Speaker's ruling 178/3—and the missing words cannot fundamentally change the meaning of the quote; if they do, the question will not be allowed. In return, a Minister can choose how much context they wish to include in their answer. All members will be familiar with the phrase ""I stand by my full statement in the context in which it was made"". The answer is so familiar as to be routine in this House and only underlines the accepted practice of quoting partial statements.",7/06/2023 14:01

237,Speech,Speaker," Members, a matter of privilege has been raised with me alleging that the Hon Jan Tinetti deliberately misled the House by failing to correct a misleading statement at the earliest opportunity. In a supplementary question on 22 February 2023, the Minister was asked to categorically state that she played no part in the delay of release of school attendance information. The Minister replied that she already had, and that it was a decision for the Ministry of Education. The Minister corrected this answer on 2 May, stating, ""I subsequently became aware that my office did have input into the timing of the release of the data through email correspondence with officials at the Ministry of Education.""",30/05/2023 14:01
238,a,Speaker,"The Minister has stated that she was informed by her staff after question time on 22 February of her staff's correspondence with the ministry on the release of data. She has also stated that she did not know that her answer needed to be corrected until she received a letter from me on 1 May, after which she corrected it. It is an important principle that the House can trust the accuracy of ministerial replies to parliamentary questions. While mistakes are sometimes made which can result in the House receiving an answer containing a misleading statement, it is vitally important that as soon as this is discovered, the Minister returns to the House to correct their answer at the earliest opportunity.",30/05/2023 14:01
239,a,Speaker,"I have considered the matter raised and considered its degree of importance. It is for the Privileges Committee to determine whether the delay in correcting an inaccurate statement, in this instance, amounts to contempt. I rule that a question of privilege does arise from the time taken to correct a misleading statement to the House. The question, therefore, stands referred to the Privileges Committee.",30/05/2023 14:01

248,a,Grant Robertson,"It is my privilege to present New Zealand's fifth Wellbeing Budget. As in each of these Budgets, we have taken into account the wellbeing of our people, the strength of our communities, the health of our environment, alongside the performance of our economy and finances. In doing so, we are striking a balance between supporting our people now with the pressure of the cost of living, and investing in future jobs and economic security.",18/05/2023 14:05
249,a,Grant Robertson,"The backdrop to Budget 2023 is challenging. It is hard to remember a time in New Zealand's history where there have been so many challenges to our economic, environmental, and social systems in such a short period of time. Individuals, families, businesses, and communities are feeling the impact of global economic and political turbulence, high inflation, the lingering hangover of the COVID emergency, and the impacts of climate change through more frequent and intense weather events.",18/05/2023 14:05
250,a,Grant Robertson,"Cost of living pressures are being felt across our communities. Budget 2023 responds to those pressures in a targeted and responsible way, building on what we have done over recent years and in a way that will not exacerbate inflation. There is a particular focus on parents and young families, including through the expansion of 20 hours' early childhood education (ECE) support to two-year-olds, free public transport for children and half price for under-25s, and the scrapping of the $5 prescription charge for all New Zealanders.",18/05/2023 14:05
251,a,Grant Robertson,"We are also making a significant commitment to support the recovery and rebuild of those regions affected by severe weather events earlier in the year. This was an unwelcome and unplanned-for series of events. But our careful financial management, and the reprioritisation programme led by the Prime Minister, has allowed us to reallocate resources and meet the Government's future contributions through the Budget allowances. We are on track to return to surplus within the forecast period, our net debt will peak at 22 percent of GDP—well below the ceiling set in our fiscal rules—and inflation is forecast to return to around 3 percent by the end of 2024.",18/05/2023 14:05
252,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2023 also looks ahead. We are very much focused on doing the basics well, with significant investment in education, health, and housing. These areas are the bedrock of opportunity for each and every New Zealander. At the same time, we are improving the resilience of New Zealand's critical infrastructure and investing in a more productive, higher-wage, lower-emissions economy, including through research and technology.",18/05/2023 14:05
253,a,Grant Robertson,The Budget strikes the critical balance between the support required today and the investment needs of the future. We have carefully cut our cloth as the emergency spending in response to COVID activities declines and we move to a more fiscally sustainable path.,18/05/2023 14:05
254,a,Grant Robertson,"New Zealand has withstood many shocks in recent memory and our wellbeing has generally held up well. However, absorbing these shocks has affected our wealth and we need to rebuild our resilience to the future challenges we know will come.",18/05/2023 14:05
255,a,Grant Robertson,"The Treasury's first wellbeing report, Te Tai Waiora, provided a broad perspective on the range of things that matter for wellbeing. It highlighted that New Zealand is a good place to live, in many ways, and that many aspects of life have improved over the past 20 years. We enjoy cleaner air, longer life expectancy, and higher incomes.",18/05/2023 14:05
256,a,Grant Robertson,"However, New Zealand faces wellbeing challenges, particularly around mental wellbeing, education, and housing quality and affordability—and these challenges are, on average, felt more strongly by our younger people. These issues are longstanding and they have not lost their urgency, and they continue to be reflected in our wellbeing objectives.",18/05/2023 14:05
257,a,Grant Robertson,"We are in a good position to meet these challenges. The New Zealand economy emerged from COVID-19 well, with modest growth anticipated over 2023. Our economic recovery from COVID is in the top 10 of OECD nations.",18/05/2023 14:05
258,a,Grant Robertson,"At 3.4 percent, the household labour force survey measure of unemployment is currently equal or lower than any period prior to 2020. New Zealand continues to have some of the lowest public debt in the world, and Budget 2023 is another step in the direction of bringing core Crown expenses as a percentage of GDP back towards pre-pandemic levels. We remain committed to returning the operating balance before gains and losses (OBEGAL) to surplus within the forecast period, and keeping net debt below the ceiling of 30 percent of GDP.",18/05/2023 14:05
259,a,Grant Robertson,"In the context of our wellbeing approach, the Government remains committed to improving child wellbeing. The latest figures released by Stats NZ show that eight out of nine of the child poverty measures have seen a significant reduction since the baseline year of 2018.",18/05/2023 14:05
260,a,Grant Robertson,"Over the last two years, child poverty rates on the measures we have comparable data for are the lowest they have been since we started measuring, and rates have almost halved on two of them. This is a testament to the comprehensive package of investments that we have put in place to support families over several years, and are continuing to do so in Budget 2023.",18/05/2023 14:05
261,a,Grant Robertson,"It is worth noting our Wellbeing Budget approach applies a gender budgeting lens into Budget 2023, expanding on last year's pilot programme. This year, it looked at 27 initiatives across 15 agencies, and this lens has influenced the range of investments, including in the cost of living space, and has been an important and useful indicator of whether the Budget is meeting our wellbeing objectives.

266,ContinueSpeech,Grant Robertson," Settle down, Mr Bishop. The Government is addressing this through Budget 2023 by introducing a matching ""employer"" contribution to paid parental leave recipients. This recognises the unpaid nature of childcare, and supports savings for retirement. It is a small but significant boost to lifetime income for many women.",18/05/2023 14:05
267,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2023 builds on the support we have been providing to New Zealanders in the face of cost of living pressures. The global inflation crisis, which has seen prices rise faster and stay higher for longer, is causing strain for many people, particularly for low and middle income households and those with young children.",18/05/2023 14:05
268,a,Grant Robertson,"The Government has already delivered significant support through the cost of living payment, reductions to fuel excise duty and road-user charges, and half-price public transport. In addition, since 1 April, more than 1.4 million New Zealanders have benefited from increased assistance to help with the cost of living—including people receiving a main benefit, students, and superannuitants. This includes 354,000 low-income New Zealanders, who we've supported through a $311 million investment from this Budget to support main benefits to increase by 7.2 percent, in line with inflation.",18/05/2023 14:05
269,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2023 focuses on targeted cost of living support that will not exacerbate inflation pressures, while also laying the foundation for long-term benefits, including educational and health outcomes, and meeting our climate change goals.",18/05/2023 14:05
270,a,Grant Robertson,"We know the first five years of a child's life are extremely important for development and learning. We also know that, right now, the cost of access to early childhood education and childcare can be a barrier for parents and caregivers wanting to enter or remain in employment, education, or training. Parents should not have to forgo ECE for their children because of the cost.",18/05/2023 14:05
271,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2023 responds to this by investing $1.8 billion in early childhood education. The flagship of this package is extending the 20 hours' support to include two-year-olds, adding to the existing three- to five-year-olds. Based on average costs in 2023, families who were not previously receiving childcare subsidies would save an estimated $133.20 per week if their child attends ECE for at least 20 hours a week.",18/05/2023 14:05
272,a,Grant Robertson,"Alongside this, we are providing further support for pay parity for ECE teachers, giving an average 5.3 percent funding increase for ECE providers, and providing a sustainability grant for Playcentre Aotearoa. We are also expanding eligibility criteria for flexible childcare assistance for low to middle income working families, extending the duration period, and indexing the rates of flexible childcare assistance to the Consumers Price Index, which will support parents with informal care costs when formal care is not available.",18/05/2023 14:05
273,a,Grant Robertson,"Altogether, this package means we will relieve the pressure of an essential cost, while also ensuring that those who provide it are adequately funded to meet increases in demand and pay for those who work in the sector appropriately. It is a substantial investment in our children, in our parents, in our teachers and caregivers, and ultimately in New Zealand's future.",18/05/2023 14:05
274,a,Grant Robertson,"In addition to these investments in our education system, Budget 2023 extends the Ngā Tini Whetū pilot run under the Whānau Ora umbrella. This focuses on ensuring that pēpi and tamariki are supported specifically in their first thousand days, alongside broader whānau aspirations.",18/05/2023 14:05
275,a,Grant Robertson,"For some New Zealanders, prescription costs are a barrier to receiving the healthcare they need, and lead to trade-offs with the purchase of other necessities. We know that in the 2021-22 financial year, 135,000 people did not collect their prescription because of the cost. I am pleased to say that from 1 July this year, we are removing the $5 prescription co-payment for all New Zealanders. This will reduce inequality in our health system and lead to better health outcomes for everyone.",18/05/2023 14:05
276,a,Grant Robertson,"We are also extending the Ka Ora, Ka Ako | Healthy School Lunch programme. Rising inflation on household incomes puts pressure on food security for families and whānau and we know learning is affected if children are hungry. Through Budget 2023, $325 million is being invested to continue this programme until the end of 2024. For families with two children, it is estimated the scheme saves, on average, $60 per week.",18/05/2023 14:05
277,a,Grant Robertson,"Access to affordable transport is a cost pressure for many New Zealanders. The Government has previously created the Community Connect public transport concession that provides half-price public transport to community services card holders. Today, I can announce that this is being extended to all under-25-year-olds and users of Total Mobility services. I know that this commitment will be welcomed particularly by tertiary students who are often reliant on public transport.",18/05/2023 14:05
278,a,Grant Robertson,The Government has decided to go further in order to support families. Budget 2023 will fund free public transport for children aged five to 12 years.,18/05/2023 14:05
279,a,Grant Robertson,"This investment of $327.4 million will help passengers meet the costs of public transport, encourage increased use, and also support New Zealand to achieve its climate change goals. It is another example of where we can both relieve the cost of living pressures for some families and contribute to our emissions reductions. ",18/05/2023 14:05
280,a,Grant Robertson,"We can also do this through household energy bills. A warm, dry home is key to improved health and wellbeing outcomes for New Zealanders. Homes that lack adequate insulation and efficient heating lead to higher energy bills and poor health outcomes.",18/05/2023 14:05
281,a,Grant Robertson,"That's why Budget 2023 is funding the extension and expansion of the Warmer Kiwi Homes programme. This will see a further 100,000 insulation and heating installations, as well as the installation of efficient hot water heaters and LED lights. Warmer Kiwi Homes is estimated to have reduced electricity use by 16 percent on average over the winter months as well as cutting the risk of respiratory illness and making homes drier and more comfortable. It is a true wellbeing policy.",18/05/2023 14:05
282,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2023 funds the critical services that New Zealanders rely on day to day, including health, education, welfare, and housing. It is vital that we continue to deliver these basic services well. There are major challenges to doing so in a high-inflation environment.",18/05/2023 14:05
283,a,Grant Robertson,Funding these services must come first in a constrained spending environment. We are investing significantly to maintain and enhance public services. This includes the public sector pay adjustment to settle a large number of pay claims across the core Public Service.,18/05/2023 14:05
284,a,Grant Robertson,"Education is critical to the success of New Zealand now and in the future. The Budget 2023 package provides $3.6 billion operating and $1.3 billion capital towards education, including tertiary education. As well as our flagship ECE package, there are a number of other key education investments.",18/05/2023 14:05
285,a,Grant Robertson,"A cornerstone is investing in a fit for purpose school property portfolio that reflects the ongoing needs of students and teachers. In Budget 2023, the Government is providing an additional 6,000 student places to the school network, and four new schools. This is in addition to $147 million to modify school buildings with automatic doors, lifts, and bathroom refits to support the needs of students.",18/05/2023 14:05
286,a,Grant Robertson,"We are also investing significant new funding to the ongoing Christchurch Schools Rebuild programme and to deliver property improvements to 175 more small, isolated schools across New Zealand. ",18/05/2023 14:05
287,a,Grant Robertson,"To expand Māori-medium education infrastructure across kura, $21.9 million operating and $112.5 million capital will be invested, which will support the Government's objective of 30 percent ākonga Māori learning in these environments by 2040. ",18/05/2023 14:05
288,a,Grant Robertson,The higher costs facing our education system is being recognised through an increase of $233.9 million for schools' operational grants and a $521 million increase for tertiary tuition and training subsidies. That increase is the biggest increase in 20 years. ,18/05/2023 14:05
289,a,Grant Robertson,These are on top of the $260 million for ECE providers mentioned earlier. The overall investment of $1 billion will help ensure education providers are resourced to deliver quality educational outcomes across the entire system.,18/05/2023 14:05
290,a,Grant Robertson,"Among other education initiatives, a highlight is the further extension of the Apprenticeship Boost programme through to 31 December 2024.

This new investment is estimated to allow 30,000 apprentices to start or continue to receive support.",18/05/2023 14:05
291,a,Grant Robertson,"We recognise the importance of the work done to support the vulnerable in our community. The Community Connectors programme provided an important service to help individuals, families, and whānau navigate and access Government support throughout COVID-19. Given its success, we are funding 100 Community Connectors for a further two years. We also know that regions affected by the recent weather events are in particular need of support, so we are providing funding for an additional 65 Community Connectors to be based in these regions.

295,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2023 will continue funding to deliver financial advice and debt services across New Zealand for those who are struggling financially.

We are also providing further funding for the Food Secure Communities initiative to support food rescue and food security, including in cyclone-affected regions.",18/05/2023 14:05
296,a,Grant Robertson,"The Government is undertaking a significant reform of the health system. To back this up, last Budget we moved to a multi-year funding approach to plan better and ensure more consistent health services.

297,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2022 provided the largest health investment ever, with $11.1 billion in new funding to put our healthcare on a sustainable financial footing, including a $1.3 billion increase for the 2023-24 year to help address historic and future cost pressures.",18/05/2023 14:05
298,a,Grant Robertson,"One year on from the establishment of Te Whatu Ora - Health New Zealand and Te Aka Whai Ora, we are focused on supporting and growing the health workforce, increasing capacity in healthcare, and expanding GP services.

301,a,Grant Robertson,"Last Budget, we instituted an integrated and long-term funding approach for our work in the justice and law and order area. Based on an agreed cross-agency plan, agencies have the certainty of a three-year pool of funding and the flexibility to move resources around to meet emerging needs. This approach is already proving successful with a fast tracking of an early intervention programme targeting recidivist young offenders in Hamilton, Auckland, and Christchurch. Less than 30 percent of those in the programme have been referred again after the intervention.",18/05/2023 14:05
302,a,Grant Robertson,"Part of the long-term funding is a commitment to keep police resources in line with the population. In addition to achieving the Government's goal of 1,800 extra police, there are resources available to keep the ratio of one officer to every 480 people.

303,a,Grant Robertson,"In line with our wellbeing objectives, this Budget continues to support Māori and Pacific economic, social, and environmental aspirations. ",18/05/2023 14:05
304,a,Grant Robertson,"A critical focus is in housing. In Budget 2023, the Government is making sizable investments in key infrastructure, such as an extra $23 million for Te Ringa Hāpai Whenua Fund to further invest in infrastructure on whenua Māori, and $200 million to increase the supply of Māori housing and to repair properties. In addition, targeted funding is provided for repairs to whānau-owned homes in cyclone-affected areas. ",18/05/2023 14:05
305,a,Grant Robertson,"We are continuing to foster the growth of Māori and Pacific languages, culture, and identity. To deliver the Pacific Languages Strategy, we will improve access to Pacific language learning resources with a $13 million commitment, and add to our already significant te reo Māori revitalisation with a $10 million boost. ",18/05/2023 14:05
306,a,Grant Robertson,"Key Māori cultural institutions will receive investments to maintain and grow their impact. This includes Te Matatini, who will receive $34 million over the next two years. We are also providing a further $18 million to support recognition and community involvement in the Matariki public holiday. ",18/05/2023 14:05
307,a,Grant Robertson,Our investments in education and whānau illustrate our commitment to laying the strongest foundations for our tamariki and supporting households experiencing cost of living pressures.,18/05/2023 14:05
308,a,Grant Robertson,"To strengthen Māori education, we are boosting teacher supply, in addition to investing significantly in the infrastructure of Māori-medium schools, as I mentioned earlier. ",18/05/2023 14:05
309,a,Grant Robertson,"To ensure families continue to receive the support they need, Budget 2023 increases investment in Whānau Ora and further expands its services in addition to the funding for Ngā Tini Whetū. ",18/05/2023 14:05
310,a,Grant Robertson,"We know that Pacific peoples are more likely than other New Zealanders to experience unemployment or low employment. That is why Budget 2023 is investing almost $13 million to implement the Pacific Employment Action Plan. This will bring Pacific workers into new employment and training opportunities, and deliver the Pacific Wellbeing Strategy, which will fund initiatives that grow the capability of the workforce.",18/05/2023 14:05
311,a,Grant Robertson,The COVID-19 pandemic and recent extreme weather events earlier this year show just how important it is to improve our resilience as a country. Severe weather in the North Island at the start of the year caused widespread disruption and damage to people's lives and properties—the scale of which will be felt for some time.,18/05/2023 14:05
312,a,Grant Robertson,"In the immediate aftermath of the events, we made urgent investments to support the response, including direct financial support to businesses and growers, repairing damaged infrastructure, and providing temporary housing and other assistance to affected families. In advance of the Budget, more than $800 million had been allocated to this emergency response work.",18/05/2023 14:05
313,a,Grant Robertson,"We are building on our immediate response by investing a total of $941 million of operating, and $195 million of capital, expenditure in Budget 2023 to support the recovery and invest in regional resilience. This package will help local government improve flood protection; invest a further $475 million to rebuild our railways, State highways, bridges, and local roads; repair damaged schools; rebuild damaged whānau homes; and ensure the provision of temporary accommodation for dislocated families. The package also invests in the provision of health and mental wellbeing services, including the extension of Mana Ake. This package also maintains our support for those people made vulnerable by these events. This includes $11 million to top up community support funds and reduce food insecurity, funding to help businesses retain staff and displaced workers to find new employment, and to help connect individuals and whānau to the support that they need. ",18/05/2023 14:05
314,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2023 also continues our support for the recovery of the primary sector and rural communities, with an additional $30 million committed to address time-sensitive health and safety and animal welfare challenges. ",18/05/2023 14:05
315,a,Grant Robertson,"This is all part of the ""rolling maul"" of support for weather-affected regions. There is further work under way on regional and sectoral strategies and on support for severely affected properties.",18/05/2023 14:05
316,a,Grant Robertson,"We are committed to a regionally led recovery where local voices are central to Government decisions. We are supporting regional recovery structures to coordinate recovery, as well as the Cyclone Gabrielle Recovery Taskforce and local Public Service coordination for each affected region. ",18/05/2023 14:05
317,a,Grant Robertson,"While we are focused on supporting families with the immediate pressures and protecting our vital services, we need to also deliver on our plan to build a high-wage, low-emissions economy to ensure security for all New Zealanders.",18/05/2023 14:05
318,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2023 investments are the building blocks for addressing New Zealand's longstanding challenges, and they lay the groundwork for taking advantage of opportunities to build a sustainable, globally competitive economy.",18/05/2023 14:05
319,a,Grant Robertson,"The Government has taken significant steps to address New Zealand's infrastructure deficit. We have committed $71 billion of infrastructure investment over the next five years, in addition to the $45 billion we have spent on infrastructure in the past five years. This is the funding that builds our schools, our hospitals, public housing, and rail and road networks. ",18/05/2023 14:05
320,a,Grant Robertson,"In the last term of Government, we set up the Infrastructure Commission / Te Waihanga, which developed the New Zealand Infrastructure Strategy, identifying the challenges New Zealand is facing over the next 30 years. We know we need to change how we think about infrastructure planning and resourcing.",18/05/2023 14:05
321,a,Grant Robertson,"Alongside this Budget, we have released our Infrastructure Action Plan, which supports our response to the strategy and which is crucial to continuing to deliver the infrastructure transformation required, while providing certainty to the construction sector. As the plan lays out, we need to futureproof our infrastructure for New Zealand's growing and changing population, climate change events, and to make use of developing technology available to us. The North Island weather events added a level of urgency to our infrastructure investment planning and highlighted the importance of resilience in the face of climate change and increasing extreme weather events. ",18/05/2023 14:05
322,a,Grant Robertson,"Today, I am announcing a major change in how we address our infrastructure deficit and build a more resilient nation. Through Budget 2023, we are investing $6 billion in the initial phase of a National Resilience Plan. This will support medium and long term infrastructure investment and focus in the first instance on building back better from the recent weather events. The initial focus of investments will likely be on road, rail, and local resilience, as well as telecommunications and electricity investment. ",18/05/2023 14:05
323,a,Grant Robertson,"As indicated at Budget 2022, the change to the fiscal rules means we can use our balance sheet more effectively to support long-term productive investments such as this programme. For too long, Governments have kicked the can down the road when it comes to investing in resilient and essential infrastructure investment. Today, we embark on the long-term nation-building that I believe a responsible Government must do.",18/05/2023 14:05
324,a,Grant Robertson,"We continue to invest significant resources into public housing through Kāinga Ora and community housing providers. I am proud to say that Budget 2023 provides funding to deliver an additional 3,000 new public homes by June 2025.",18/05/2023 14:05
325,a,Grant Robertson,"The turnaround in the building of public housing is one of the signature achievements of our Labour Government. So far, we have delivered 11,830 more public homes and 4,131 transitional homes. There are close to 4,500 public housing places currently under construction. Budget 2023 also covers the increased costs caused by inflation for finishing that work. ",18/05/2023 14:05
326,a,Grant Robertson,"New Zealand's national rail network is critical for passenger transportation and freight services. In Budget 2023, we are providing $369.2 million to continue to develop a resilient and reliable national rail service. ",18/05/2023 14:05
327,a,Grant Robertson,"To address cost increases, the Government is investing $9.4 million operating and $197 million capital in the Auckland City Rail Link project to provide a key link within Auckland's public transport network. ",18/05/2023 14:05
328,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2023 includes significant investments in research and development to deliver on the Future Pathways reforms of our public research system. This is consistent with our commitment to increase research and development expenditure to 2 percent of GDP. The centrepiece of this investment is the establishment of three new multi-institution research hubs focused on health and wellbeing; oceans, climate, and hazards; and advanced manufacturing, biotech, and energy. ",18/05/2023 14:05
329,a,Grant Robertson,"This $451 million investment will drive innovation, collaboration, and export-earning potential. It is an exciting development bringing public and private sector together to solve significant problems and foster growth of our science sector. Backing this up is investment in research fellowships and an applied doctoral training scheme, for more than 260 people, to fill skills gaps and grow a sustainable research system.",18/05/2023 14:05
330,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2023 continues our investment in industries that will drive us towards a high-wage, low-emissions economy. We will invest a further $74.7 million in our Industry Transformation Plans. This includes $30 million for the horticulture technology sector, which we will assist to develop more productive ways of operating, including for those affected by the cyclone. The Budget also provides new investment in the digital and tourism transformation plans.",18/05/2023 14:05
331,a,Grant Robertson,"The game development sector is a growing part of our economy. In 2022, it contributed $400 million to GDP, and is the source of high-value jobs that are driving export returns. The sector is an internationally competitive one, and we are at risk of losing our talent overseas. Budget 2023 includes $160 million to establish a 20 percent rebate for video game developers, which will help grow and protect New Zealand's domestic game development sector. Individual game developers will be able to access up to $3 million as part of the scheme.",18/05/2023 14:05
332,a,Grant Robertson,"In Budget 2022, the Government established the Climate Emergency Response Fund (CERF) as a permanent feature of the annual Budget process. The CERF supports New Zealand's climate change objectives by providing dedicated funding to initiatives that support the transition to a low-emissions and climate-resilient economy. In Budget 2023, there is a $1.9 billion CERF package to further reduce emissions and enhance our resilience to climate change.",18/05/2023 14:05
333,a,Grant Robertson,"As already noted, we are expanding the Warmer Kiwi Homes programme and reducing the cost of public transport for hundreds of thousands of Kiwis.",18/05/2023 14:05
334,a,Grant Robertson,"In addition, we are expanding our electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure. In many areas of New Zealand, especially in rural communities, there is not the charging infrastructure to support the exceptional growth in the number of EVs. Budget 2023 will begin the roll-out of our EV charging strategy, which will see charging hubs every 150 to 200 kilometres on main highways, and public charging at community facilities for all settlements of more than 2,000 people.",18/05/2023 14:05
335,a,Grant Robertson,"Funding is also being made available to support the purchase of low-emission heavy vehicles, like trucks and buses, to build on the success of the Clean Car Discount and the Low Emissions Transport Fund. It is estimated that this will see 500 low-emission heavy vehicles on the road, saving operators' fuel costs by up to 75 percent.",18/05/2023 14:05
336,a,Grant Robertson,"The CERF is also supporting the $300 million capital injection to the New Zealand Green Investment Fund, a renewable energy system for the Chatham Islands, and funding for community-scale renewable energy generation and storage.",18/05/2023 14:05
337,a,Grant Robertson,"The size and make-up of the Budget 2023 CERF package reflects the scale and breadth of the challenge ahead of us, while prioritising resources to where they can have the greatest impact.",18/05/2023 14:05
338,a,Grant Robertson,"Putting Budget 2023 together has required challenging trade-offs and decisions. Along with the investments we need to make to help reduce the pressure of the cost of living, delivering public services, and our resilience and recovery, we also have to move to a more sustainable fiscal position.",18/05/2023 14:05
339,a,Grant Robertson,"The last few Budgets have supported our response to, and our recovery from, the impact of COVID. This has necessitated significant spending, which is now reducing. The forecasts in this Budget see core Crown spending as a percentage of GDP tracking back to just above the long-term average at 31.5 percent by the end of the forecast period. We need to move carefully in reducing spending so we don't undermine the investments we have made, but this direction of travel is important for the long-term prosperity of New Zealand.",18/05/2023 14:05
340,a,Grant Robertson,"Persistent inflation has meant that the costs of delivering Government services have increased. And it has been necessary to slightly increase the operating allowances set at the Budget Policy Statement for this year and in out-years in order to meet these costs, including the cyclone and flood recovery, rather than cut essential services.",18/05/2023 14:05
341,a,Grant Robertson,The Treasury is forecasting inflation will decline across the next few years to 3.3 percent in 2024 and 2.6 percent in 2025.,18/05/2023 14:05
342,a,Grant Robertson,"Even with the investments that we have made, New Zealand continues to have some of the lowest public debt in the world. New Zealand's net debt is forecast to peak at 22 percent of GDP next year before reducing to 18.4 percent at the end of the forecast period. This compares well, using IMF measures, with the likes of Australia at 36 percent, the United Kingdom at 95 percent, and the United States at 96 percent.",18/05/2023 14:05
343,a,Grant Robertson,"Anchored by the fiscal rules that we set at Budget 2022, we are on track to return the OBEGAL to surplus within the forecast period, although one year later than was forecast at the half-year update. The costs of responding to the cyclone and more persistent inflation are the cause of this, but it is worth bearing in mind that this will be the same length of time that the previous Government took to return to surplus after the global financial crisis (GFC). Average deficits as a share of GDP remain lower than in the wake of the GFC.",18/05/2023 14:05
344,a,Grant Robertson,"Our prudent fiscal strategy of running surpluses and reducing net debt before COVID meant that we had a stronger starting position than other countries. It meant we could use our balance sheet to protect lives and livelihoods during the pandemic. This has helped prevent a deep and long-lasting recession. Treasury is, in fact, forecasting that the economy will not now go into recession. New Zealand's fiscal position remains strong, and the fiscal forecasts stronger than expected, even in the face of the increasing costs of delivering core Government services, and the recent weather disasters. In total, $4 billion in savings and reprioritisations have been achieved to offset new spending this Budget.",18/05/2023 14:05
345,a,Grant Robertson,"We will approach future Budgets with the same restraint to ensure a sure footing for our public finances for generations to come. As they were at this Budget, Ministers will be required to identify opportunities for the reprioritisation of resources and improvement of efficiencies within baselines before seeking new funding. Finding opportunities to cut back spending and to redirect funding from one activity to another helps us ensure that funding is directed to the highest-value activities and that the Government is focused on the issues most important to New Zealanders.",18/05/2023 14:05
346,a,Grant Robertson,"Significant reprioritisation of funding has been achieved for Budget 2023, including $280 million from reducing funding no longer needed for fees-free tertiary education, and $385.8 million from the COVID health tagged contingency, while still leaving enough support for our COVID response for this winter.",18/05/2023 14:05
347,a,Grant Robertson,"Alongside Budget 2023, the Government has refreshed its priorities to focus on the issues that are most important to New Zealanders. This also yielded significant savings which we have used to offset new spending at Budget 2023. This includes $364 million from stopping the TVNZ-RNZ merger, $585.1 million from stopping the Clean Car Upgrade and social leasing trial, and $500 million from the refocused water services reforms.",18/05/2023 14:05
348,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2023 also includes tax changes that improve the integrity of our tax system by bringing the trustee tax rate in line with the top personal rate. This change will help ensure that the top marginal tax rate applies more comprehensively to individuals with income over $180,000. This approach was recommended by officials when the top income tax rate was increased. Ministers undertook to monitor the situation and we are now acting. It is interesting to note that just 5 percent of trusts accounted for 78 percent of the income in the 2021 tax year. This change addresses a potential loophole while also making sure there is more equity in our tax system.",18/05/2023 14:05
349,a,Grant Robertson,"Our total savings and revenue changes have allowed us to keep core Government services running in a high-inflation environment, support New Zealanders with the rising cost of living, and respond to the recent North Island weather disasters—all while ensuring we keep net debt well below its ceiling of 30 percent of GDP, and that we are on track to deliver an operating surplus by 2025-26. That is a balanced fiscal strategy.",18/05/2023 14:05
350,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2023 comes at a time of considerable pressure on households, businesses, and amid international uncertainty, persistent high inflation, and global supply chain issues. It is a Budget that does exactly what it says on the tin: support for today and building for tomorrow. We know many New Zealanders are doing it tough right now, and we are here to support them as we have done over recent years. ",18/05/2023 14:05
351,a,Grant Robertson,"Doing the basics well, including providing strong investment in the services that New Zealanders rely on, has to be the priority right now. There are many things the Government might like to do, or tax cuts that other parties might decide to promise, but, for me, keeping our children safe, warm, and dry at school has to come first. Building 3,000 more State housing places has to come first. Funding our health system for 500 more nurses has to come first. Having more police on the front line has to come first. Support for people with disabilities, older New Zealanders, and the vulnerable has to come first.",18/05/2023 14:05
352,a,Grant Robertson,"These investments don't happen by chance, and they are ultimately at risk if there is not a Government determined that they will be there; they happen because a Government prioritises them and because we know they matter to our people.",18/05/2023 14:05
353,a,Grant Robertson,"We also know that, even in tough times, it is vital we look to a better tomorrow. Our investments in our people, our businesses, our communities, and our environment will guide us to that place. We are making investments in this Budget that will build our nation for the future.",18/05/2023 14:05
354,a,Grant Robertson,"We are a resilient and innovative country, and one where opportunities abound. Once again, through Budget 2023, this Labour Government is ensuring that each and every New Zealander can seize those opportunities and achieve their potential. Kia kaha, kia māia, kia manawanui.

366,a,Barbara Edmonds,"The Prime Minister and I, and local MPs Grant Robertson, Ibrahim Omer, and Paul Eagle, have just returned from Newtown. Along with Mayor Tory Whanau, we met with some of those affected. We met first responders and witnessed the distress on their faces. We heard stories of the scene that confronted Fire and Emergency and police when they first arrived.",16/05/2023 14:01
367,a,Barbara Edmonds,"At approximately 12.25 a.m. this morning, Fire and Emergency were called to what they knew would be a significant fire in a hostel in Wellington. I'm advised that the first fire truck arrived at 12.30 a.m. Crews found the fire was already well involved. The fire was quickly elevated to fifth alarm, the highest level. There were 20 fire appliances on the scene by 4 a.m. At its peak, there were 29 fire crews involved, with more than 80 firefighters from all over Wellington. Fire crews rescued five people off the roof, using a specialist aerial appliance. They helped save many, many lives. Fire and Emergency's communication centre staff, who were taking 111 calls from people trapped in the building, did an exceptional job; they, too, undoubtedly saved lives last night.",16/05/2023 14:01
368,a,Barbara Edmonds,"The Prime Minister and I spoke with national commander Russell Wood and the incident controller, district manager Nick Pyatt, and firefighters at the scene this morning. The toll on our firefighters and communication centre staff is not to be underestimated. The devastation I saw on the faces of those involved was unmistakable. All I can say is thank you for your incredible service and your bravery.",16/05/2023 14:01
369,a,Barbara Edmonds,"Thank you also to police and Wellington Free Ambulance for the work they too have done overnight. Thank you especially to the staff at Wellington Hospital, literally just around the corner from the fire. Staff in the emergency department helped to triage patients and treat those most in need.",16/05/2023 14:01
370,a,Barbara Edmonds,"Fire and Emergency have told me that their key focus now is the wellbeing of its people and investigating the fire. At this stage, the cause of the fire is unexplained, and police will be working alongside Fire and Emergency to determine the cause. Police are asking people to please come forward if they or someone they know have been staying at the property; please contact 105, referencing Operation Rose.",16/05/2023 14:01
371,a,Barbara Edmonds,"The Ministry of Social Development and other agencies are working closely with Wellington City Council, which is leading the welfare response. Staff are onsite at the welfare centre at Newtown Park pavilion to look after those who have been affected. The residents have literally lost everything; maybe some, just the keys to the door of their room. We thank the Wellington City Mission and the Salvation Army as well for their support on the ground. We will work hard to ensure that those affected have a roof over their head.",16/05/2023 14:01
372,a,Barbara Edmonds,"Newtown is a microcosm of the Wellington region. The people who live there are a mix of working professionals, newly arrived migrants, refugees, students, young families, retired people, those living with the support of central and local government, and our community agencies, like the Salvation Army and City Mission. It is multicultural, full of character and diversity. Whether you are the Governor-General in the grandest house, or a newly arrived family fleeing a war zone overseas, there is a place for you in Newtown.

I want to begin by thanking members of the Primary Production Committee, and our officials who responded to questions during the course of our hearings.",16/05/2023 15:18
376,a,Steph Lewis,"As per the previous two years, we decided to consider our report on the primary sector as a whole, rather than reporting on each separate entity. We've had hearings from the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI), from Land Information New Zealand, Pāmu Farms, and Crown Irrigation Investments. We also had written reports from Animal Control Products Ltd, AssureQuality Ltd, New Zealand Walking Access Commission, and Quotable Value.",16/05/2023 15:18
377,a,Steph Lewis,"I want to also acknowledge, as the officials in our hearings and the Ministers in our hearings did, the impact that both Cyclone Hale and Cyclone Gabrielle have had on our primary industries—the devastation that our food producers and growers over the course of those two cyclones have experienced between Northland, all the way down as far as the Wairarapa, particularly impacted on the west coast. So I want to acknowledge all of those affected, and acknowledge as well the Ministry for Primary Industries, who, at the time of the writing of the committee's report, had provided more than $55 million worth of support to our primary producers.",16/05/2023 15:18
378,a,Steph Lewis,"I'd like to comment on some of the topics that the committee canvassed with officials during the course of the hearings—in particular, around the international pressure to reduce emissions. We noted that the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism—CBAM—which is a tariff on carbon-intensive goods entering the EU, such as fertiliser and cement, will take full effect by 2026. We heard from the Minister around the negotiations in the free-trade agreements and the need for us to strive to stay at the lower end of the emissions scale for our food production; provided we can do that, we will remain in a good position. We need to ensure that we are investing in emissions-reducing technologies elsewhere, just the same as our international competitors are doing. We heard as well that the Government is invested in an emissions-reduction programme, which was pleasing to hear; it includes launching the Centre for Climate Action on Agricultural Emissions, which was opened in November 2022. The centre's purpose is to accelerate research and development and the commercialisation of tools and technology to help reduce agricultural emissions. ",16/05/2023 15:18
379,a,Steph Lewis,"There's been a lot of interest in forestry as well—in particular, the overseas purchase of productive New Zealand farmland and the conversion of that to forestry. We note that both the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Forestry said that highly productive farmland should not be converted to forestry. We had the opportunity to talk to Toitū Te Whenua—or Land Information New Zealand—about the special forestry test, and they advised us that both the special forestry test and the benefit to New Zealand test potentially support forestry; however, the special forestry test only allows overseas investment in existing forests, and therefore it doesn't permit carbon forestry. The land must be currently forested and the test does not allow forests to be planted on land that has not been forested in the past.",16/05/2023 15:18

409,a,Chris Hipkins,"On 6 May, I was privileged to attend the coronation of His Majesty King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Westminster Abbey. It was a rare and special event. The previous coronation, of Queen Elizabeth II, took place 70 years ago, in 1953. The world is a very different place now to what it was in 1953, and the coronation provided an opportunity to reflect on history as well as to look ahead to the future. ",9/05/2023 14:02
410,a,Chris Hipkins,"King Charles automatically became the King of New Zealand on 8 September last year, following the death of the late Queen. The coronation was a celebration of his accession to the throne not just of the United Kingdom but as head of State of 15 nations around the world, including our own. Those nations span across three different continents. It was a great source of pride to see New Zealand's Defence Force personnel marching in the procession and to have New Zealand represented among the guests. ",9/05/2023 14:02
411,a,Chris Hipkins,"Attending in London and being able to meet personally with the King reinforced to me his genuine interest in our people and his awareness of our place in the world. The King and other members of the royal family have been closely following our recovery from the recent Auckland floods and Cyclone Gabrielle, and King Charles' passion around environmental issues, including climate change, was clearly very evident in our discussions. ",9/05/2023 14:02
412,a,Chris Hipkins,"King Charles has visited New Zealand 10 times, and he has a strong personal commitment to Aotearoa. The themes he selected for his coronation were youth, diversity, and sustainability—themes which also resonate strongly with New Zealanders. ",9/05/2023 14:02
413,a,Chris Hipkins,"While not everyone in our nation, or even in this House, shares similar views on the role of the monarchy in a modern society—and public debate will, undoubtedly, continue on that topic—I'm sure that everyone will join with me in congratulating His Majesty on this significant milestone. The coronation was a moment where the King publicly took oaths of service and duty. I know that he takes those oaths seriously and deeply personally. I wish King Charles well in his role, and I send the warmest wishes and congratulations to His Majesty and to the Queen for the lives of service that they have committed to, on behalf of all New Zealanders.

419,a,Nicole Mckee,"Our King was home-schooled in Buckingham Palace until just before his eighth birthday, when he was sent to school in West London, the first heir apparent to go to school instead of continuing home-schooling in the palace. He was also sent to school in Scotland—where he described it as being at ""Colditz in kilts""—as well as six months studying at Timbertop in Australia. He graduated from school in Berkshire as head boy, and instead of going straight into the armed forces, he went to Trinity College in Cambridge, where he studied archaeology and anthropology, followed by history.",9/05/2023 14:11

423,a,Nicole Mckee,"We've had a couple of King Charleses in the past. The rule of King Charles I led to a revolution and the temporary abolition of the monarchy. He was convicted of high treason and beheaded in 1625. King Charles II, son of King Charles I, took the throne in 1660 for 25 years when the monarchy was restored. This King Charles had to rule during the 1665 Great Plague and the 1666 Great Fire of London. The King Charles spaniel is named after him. Then there was the unrecognised King Charles III when, in 1745 and 1746, Charles Edward Stuart led the unsuccessful Jacobite rising, declaring himself King Charles III, but it was never acknowledged officially. He became known instead as Stuart the Pretender or Bonnie Prince Charlie.",9/05/2023 14:11
424,a,Nicole Mckee,"I'd like to finish up talking of some of the little-known facts about our official King Charles III. He likes eggs and chose a quiche as a signature dish. He's a fan of Emmerdale Farm. He's taken up many causes over the years, and one that he took up was for better equipment for British forces in Iraq. Another was to expand, not restrict, the availability of herbal medicines. He has a tree frog named after him, Prince Charles Magnificent Tree Frog, and The Guardian once reported that he converted his vintage Aston Martin to run on surplus English white wine and whey from the cheese process—biofuel. But it was thought that this could do more harm than good if it was adopted on a wider scale.",9/05/2023 14:11
425,a,Nicole Mckee,"King Charles III has spent 71 years preparing for his coronation day. His life experiences have taught him humility, understanding, and tolerance, all while his entire life has been on show to the world. Here to serve instead of being served.

In Auckland, a state of local emergency has been declared by the mayor. A red severe thunderstorm warning is in place for Northland and Auckland. A line of thunderstorms is tracking across these regions and these are likely to be accompanied by torrential rain. An emergency mobile alert has been sent to the whole of the Auckland region advising people of potential impacts and suggesting they plan travel accordingly.

Follow the instructions of emergency services and local CDEM groups, and if you feel unsafe at any time, please evacuate to higher ground. Check Waka Kotahi New Zealand Transport Agency's website for road closures before you travel, and drive to the conditions. Please never walk or drive through floodwater and don't let children play in it.

451,a,Grant Robertson,"This is an annual event for the House. It concerns the appropriations for our three Offices of Parliament: the Controller and Auditor-General, the Ombudsman, and the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment. As is described in the motion that I've just moved, it sets out alterations for the year that we're in now for inclusion in the Supplementary Estimates bill and sets out the main appropriations that will be included in the main appropriation bill that I will introduce on Budget day. The reason we do it this way round is to emphasise the independence of these Offices of Parliament from the executive.",9/05/2023 19:36
452,a,Grant Robertson,"The proposals in the address have been examined by the Officers of Parliament Committee, which has the Speaker as its chairperson. I want to thank all members of the committee for their careful consideration of these matters, which they did with some advice available to them from Treasury officials. The committee's report explains the issues behind the numbers proposed in the address, and I've no doubt that other members of the committee may choose to address some of those matters in their contributions in the debate.",9/05/2023 19:36
453,a,Grant Robertson,"All three Offices of Parliament are reporting an increasingly complex, changing, and demanding environment that puts additional pressure upon resources. The Auditor-General is facing larger-than-usual deficits over the next three years, which the committee informs us is due to increasing audit complexity—mostly relating to COVID-19—pressure on auditors' capacity and availability, and audit costs rising faster than audit fees while Audit New Zealand works to increase its staffing. The committee therefore have agreed that a non-recoverable capital injection, totalling $16 million over three years, of $2 million in this financial year, $7 million in the next, and the remainder in the following year are appropriate. Audit delays because of COVID-19 and higher staff turnover are an issue. The committee has told us that the Auditor-General is addressing these issues with approaches that include raising fees and seeking greater financial efficiencies.",9/05/2023 19:36
454,a,Grant Robertson,"COVID-19 also continues to have a significant impact on the work of the Ombudsman, whose responsibilities have expanded in recent years, including the managed isolation and quarantine facilities, the protected disclosure Act investigations, and enhanced oversight of Oranga Tamariki. Legislation that has just come into force has also expanded the Ombudsman's jurisdiction to cover providers of care and custody under Oranga Tamariki. The Ombudsman has welcomed this change, though it will increase work for the office. The Ombudsman's also forecasting an increase in complaints driven by Cyclone Gabrielle and flooding in 2023. Again, as similar with the Auditor-General, retaining trained staff and experienced staff is also an issue, and the committee tells us that they support a one-off targeted payment for high-performing staff.",9/05/2023 19:36
455,a,Grant Robertson,"Issues around staffing were also raised by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, who faces a growing need to source external, legal, and scientific advice as well. The Parliamentary Commissioner has not sought an increase to his appropriation in this Budget round, though he foresees a need for additional funding in a Budget round in the near future.",9/05/2023 19:36
456,a,Grant Robertson,"The three Officers of Parliament continue to provide excellent work on behalf of New Zealanders and make a strong contribution to our democracy. I want to reiterate that it is my job here today to move this. This is the report of the Officers of Parliament Committee. They make their decision independent of the executive, but we need to do it now, tonight, so that it gets into the Budget processes that start next week. So, on that basis, I commend this motion to the House.",9/05/2023 19:36

461,Speech,Speaker," I wish to clarify for members the role of the Speaker in relation to the creation of vacancies under the Electoral Act 1993. A seat of a member becomes vacant only if one of the circumstances set out in section 55 of the Electoral Act 1993 has arisen. If the Speaker is satisfied that a seat has become vacant in accordance with that section, then the Speaker publishes a notice of the vacancy. See sections 192(1) and 134(1). There is no other basis on which a vacancy can occur. Representation in this House is central to our democracy. As Speaker, I must be careful to ensure the law is applied correctly in such cases. ",4/05/2023 14:01
462,a,Speaker,"As I advised the House yesterday, section 55A(3) is very clear that, for the purposes of the Electoral Act 1993, a member ceases to be a parliamentary member of the political party for which the member was elected only if a written notice is delivered to the Speaker that complies with section 55B or 55C. I have not received a message that complies with either of these sections. ",4/05/2023 14:01
463,a,Speaker,"There is no leeway for the Speaker to declare a seat vacant if they are informed or become aware of the information that a member has ceased to be a parliamentary member of the political party for which the member was elected in any way other than through such a written notice. Like you all, I have seen media coverage stating that the Hon Meka Whaitiri intended to leave one party and join another. But those statements themselves do not cause the member's seat to become vacant. ",4/05/2023 14:01
464,a,Speaker,"Section 55B of the Electoral Act 1993 provides that for a notice from a member to have the effect of making that member's seat become vacant, the notice would need to be signed by the member giving the notice and be addressed to the Speaker. It would also need to notify the Speaker that the member had resigned from the parliamentary membership of the political party for which they were elected, or that they wished to be recognised for parliamentary purposes as an Independent member or a member of another political party. A communication that does not comply with these requirements is not a notice that gives rise to a vacancy.",4/05/2023 14:01
465,a,Speaker,"As I have outlined previously, I have received a message from the Hon Meka Whaitiri informing me that her vote would no longer be cast by the Labour Party and that she wished to be seated in the Chamber next to members of Te Paati Māori. It therefore is not a written notice that complies with Section 55B of the Electoral Act 1993.",4/05/2023 14:01
466,a,Speaker,"As Speaker, I must administer the House's procedures, and this is problematic when a member's party status is unclear. In practical terms, I need to rule on how to treat a member who no longer sits or votes with the party they sat and voted with previously. Using my judgment and the knowledge I had that the Hon Meka Whaitiri no longer wishes to serve as a member of the Labour Party, I determined that under Standing Order 35(5), the member would be regarded as an Independent member for parliamentary purposes. This means that the member will have rights to ask oral questions and speak in debates in proportion to the fact that they are one of 119 members in the House, and the Labour Party's allocation will be adjusted accordingly. The member also will need to apply to me if she wishes to seek permission to be absent.",4/05/2023 14:01
467,Speech,Michael Woodhouse," Point of order, Mr Speaker. Thank you for your further clarification of the situation. I have two questions: first, are you prepared to release all of the communications regarding this matter, and, if the answer to that question is no, does that decision preclude the Hon Meka Whaitiri herself from releasing those communications, including the communications from the Speaker's office back to her?",4/05/2023 14:03
468,Speech,Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I was hoping that question would be asked.,4/05/2023 14:07
469,Interjection,Michael Woodhouse, Happy to oblige.,4/05/2023 14:07
470,ContinueSpeech,Speaker," Thank you. As Speaker, I receive correspondence with members daily. It is extremely important that members can trust that all such correspondence can remain confidential, but in this particular case I can reiterate that I have not received any correspondence from either the member or the Labour Party that complies with section 55B or 55C of the Electoral Act respectively. I can also say that I cannot release that information, but the Hon Meka Whaitiri is able to if she wishes to do so.",4/05/2023 14:07
471,Speech,James Shaw," Point of order, Mr Speaker. Thank you, Mr Speaker, for that. I found that clarifying after the confusion that we had yesterday.",4/05/2023 14:08
472,a,James Shaw,"The one bit that I just want to understand is towards the end of your statement, when you talked about the understanding that she would now be treated as an Independent MP, but I understood from the earlier part of the statement that, because the Hon Meka Whaitiri had not notified you that she was resigning as a parliamentary member of the Labour Party, then, essentially, she is still a member of the parliamentary Labour Party. It doesn't then follow that she can both be a member of the parliamentary Labour Party and also an Independent MP at the same time. Whereas I was following you were saying that she has notified that her vote has been withdrawn and that she wants to sit somewhere else in the House, but that doesn't change her status as a member of the parliamentary Labour Party. It just means that her vote is treated differently and she sits somewhere differently, but it doesn't then follow that allocation of questions and so on would move away from the Labour Party, because that would indicate that she has left the parliamentary Labour Party, which she hasn't notified you that she has.",4/05/2023 14:08
473,Speech,Speaker," Under Standing Order 36, the Labour Party has now advised me that the Hon Meka Whaitiri is no longer a member of the Labour Party.",4/05/2023 14:10
474,Interjection,David Seymour," Speaking to that, Mr Speaker.",4/05/2023 14:10
475,ContinueSpeech,Speaker, A new point of order?,4/05/2023 14:10
476,Speech,David Seymour," Yes. To help understand that, would it be fair to say that Meka Whaitiri is now an Independent member under the Standing Orders, but a member of the parliamentary Labour Party so far as the Electoral Act is concerned? ",4/05/2023 14:10
477,Speech,Grant Robertson," Speaking to that point of order, I think I get what Mr Seymour is saying in that particular point of order, which is to make the point that the Standing Orders are the rules of this Parliament, and the Electoral Act are the rules of the land. They are by and large consistent, although, for example, there are things you can say outside Parliament you can't say inside it and so on. So I think the point Mr Seymour is making there is that there is an Electoral Act that has a particular set of information; there are the Standing Orders that have another set of information within them.",4/05/2023 14:10
478,Interjection,David Seymour," I was hoping that you might clarify, Mr Speaker.",4/05/2023 14:10
479,Speech,Speaker," I thank—actually, I thank both members, because both the question and the contribution actually answered the question: yes.",4/05/2023 14:11
480,Speech,Gerry Brownlee," Point of order, Mr Speaker. It can't be the case that both positions are correct. One has to be correct. The other, simply, was a notification of what we all know to be the fact: there is a set of Standing Orders; there is the Electoral Act. The thing that's most interesting is that you've just said that the Labour Party have notified you that Meka Whaitiri has resigned from the Labour Party. Now, what's the standing of that, because anybody could send you a letter from anywhere saying that, you know, so-and-so has resigned from their party. There has to be some basis for you to accept that, and then, when you do accept that, how does that stack up? It's a notification to you about a member having resigned from the party that they were elected to.",4/05/2023 14:11
481,a,Gerry Brownlee,The next point I'd make is: is it possible now for members just to write to you to suggest where they would prefer to be sat inside this Parliament?,4/05/2023 14:11
482,Speech,Speaker," What I will say in response to the point of order is that this House makes the laws—that's the first thing I'd say. The second thing I'd like to say: if I had've accepted and notified yesterday that the Hon Meka Whaitiri—that her seat was vacant, we'd be having an altogether different constitutional discussion right now. The only way the member can vacate the seat is by telling me under section 55 of the Act. Now, as I've told this House several times, that has not been complied with. Given that fact, there has to be some way that the Hon Meka Whaitiri is to carry out her parliamentary work, and so I have said—as I have said—for parliamentary purposes, I'm considering that she is an Independent member.",4/05/2023 14:12
483,Speech,Gerry Brownlee," Point of order, Mr Speaker. Will you be releasing, for us all to see, the advice that you've had on how you've interpreted—",4/05/2023 14:14
484,Interjection,Speaker," Sorry, I missed the first part of that.",4/05/2023 14:14
485,ContinueSpeech,Gerry Brownlee," Yeah. Will you be releasing, so that we can all see, the advice that you've had with regards to that? Because it seems to me somewhat odd that you can determine that someone is an Independent without having left their political party, and that would also then suggest that the trigger for those two clauses that you have repeatedly recited this afternoon is somewhat less than the test that you yourself are applying to them. ",4/05/2023 14:14
486,Speech,Grant Robertson," Speaking to the point of order, Mr Speaker. Just to pick up a point that you made: under Standing Order 36, the Labour Party is obliged to write to you if there is a change in our membership. We have done that—that's what you just said before. So, you know, we've fulfilled our obligations in that regard. It is at that point you then make decisions about what you need to do in response to that. It is the identical set of circumstances that occurred when Jami-Lee Ross was both expelled from and resigned from the National Party on the same day. Under those circumstances, Speaker Mallard indicated what he would do in that situation. So we have fulfilled our obligations to do that. How that then relates to the matters within the Electoral Act relates to your earlier comments about what is required for that to happen. ",4/05/2023 14:14
487,Interjection,Gerry Brownlee, Point of order. ,4/05/2023 14:14
488,Speech,Speaker," No, I'm going to rule on this, thank you. As I stated before, in terms of releasing information, communications, between myself and members, I think every single member in this House should be wary of that. As I stated before, I receive daily communications from members. That confidence—[Interruption] Who is commentating over there?",4/05/2023 14:15
489,Interjection,Simeon Brown," Oh, look, I made a comment—",4/05/2023 14:15
490,ContinueSpeech,Speaker," This is the probably one of the most serious things I've ever had to rule on, and having commentary from you, Mr Brown, is really not helpful. ",4/05/2023 14:15
491,a,Speaker,"Mr Brownlee, so it is really in the interest of every member that the Speaker not be able to release private communications on anything, but it's entirely appropriate that members, if they choose to do so, can do so.",4/05/2023 14:15
492,Speech,Chris Bishop," Point of order, Mr Speaker. Thank you, Mr Speaker; we appreciate your elucidation. I think there is one bit that we're all interested in, which is: if it would be possible for you to explain in a bit more detail how the communication you had from the Hon Meka Whaitiri did not fit within the terms of the relevant parts of the Electoral Act, because I think many people watching, and in this House, actually, regard the communication as having complied in the sense that it was sent to you, it was a message, it indicated an intent to resign from the parliamentary Labour Party and, in fact, join another party. You've outlined what the law is, carefully and deliberately. But you haven't outlined—and I think it might be helpful if you outline—how what happened didn't meet with the law, and so the factual scenario and how it measures with the law. That, I think, would be useful for us.",4/05/2023 14:16
493,Speech,Speaker," I can say to you, Mr Bishop, that you have made a number of assumptions about what you think—",4/05/2023 14:18
494,Interjection,Nicola Willis," Well, just clear it up.",4/05/2023 14:18
495,ContinueSpeech,Speaker," Nicola Willis will stand, withdraw, and apologise.",4/05/2023 14:18
496,Interjection,Nicola Willis, I withdraw and apologise.,4/05/2023 14:18
497,ContinueSpeech,Speaker," Mr Bishop, you have made a number of assumptions that are incorrect. It is not for me, after telling this House that I will not be releasing that information, to then discuss that information. That is private communication between the Speaker and a member. Any member can ask for advice. Any member can communicate with me about any matter they would like. I'm absolutely certain that none of the parties want to know and none of the members want me to tell you things that I get told as Speaker of the House. That would be highly inappropriate. I stand by what I've said before. It's entirely up to the members themselves if they wish to release any communication with me.",4/05/2023 14:18
498,Speech,Gerry Brownlee," Point of order, Mr Speaker. Can I just make it clear: I wasn't asking for that to be released. I think communications between the Speaker and members should remain between the Speaker and the member. I fully accept that. But you've read out to the House this afternoon a ruling which clearly would have had some advice provided to you in the preparation of that ruling. That advice, most likely, would have gone to some explanation—more explanation than you were able to read in the ruling that you did read—about how each of those particular provisions interact, and why it is that the conclusion should be reached that has led to your ruling today. Now, that can't be confidential. That would be between the Office of the Clerk and the Speaker, and I would have thought that that is information that should be available to every member of the House.",4/05/2023 14:19
499,Speech,David Parker," Speaking to the point of order, I suspect the answer to that is that, if the Speaker had received a notice in accordance with section 55—whatever the subsection is—of the Electoral Act that was in accordance with the Act, he would have acted on it and released the letter. That's not the sort of communication to which the Speaker's referring.",4/05/2023 14:20
500,Interjection,Gerry Brownlee, I think the point has been missed.,4/05/2023 14:20
501,Speech,Speaker," I would add to the mix that I am capable of carrying out the Office of the Speaker, and when I read things, some things are glaringly obvious to any member. The Hon David Parker is correct also.",4/05/2023 14:20
502,Speech,Speaker," Members, we now come to the debate about local issues arranged by the Business Committee under Standing Order 80. Before I call a member, there is no speaking list. Members, I do have a list as advised by both members and parties, as I am fully aware, but any member can stand. It's about local issues, not the impact of a general Government policy, and so I'll be arranging things thusly. ",4/05/2023 15:16
503,a,Speaker,"Also, the speaking time is five minutes. You've been distributed approximate times for each party. It's up to each party to manage their own time—I won't be doing that—but members have up to five minutes, so if they have split it amongst their party, they should monitor those timings themselves. ",4/05/2023 15:16
504,Speech,Speaker," I'm sure that members would wish to welcome Mr Asao Keiichiro and Mr Ito Shintaro from the National Diet of Japan, who are present in the gallery.",3/05/2023 14:01
505,Speech,Speaker," Members, I wish to inform you that under Standing Order 35(5) the Hon Meka Whaitiri is from today regarded as an independent member for parliamentary purposes. ",3/05/2023 14:01
506,Speech,Michael Woodhouse," I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Thank you, Mr Speaker, for that advice. I raise matters with you that I think have some very important constitutional merit. This morning, at the Waipatu Marae in Hastings, the member for Ikaroa-Rāwhiti, addressing a hui, made the following comment: ""This morning, I have officially notified the Speaker that I have resigned from the New Zealand Labour Party and have joined Te Paati Māori, effective immediately."" Now, as you know, under sections 55A and 55B of the Electoral Act, a member who ceases to be a parliamentary member of the political party for which the member was elected, where they cease to be a member, vacates that seat, effectively. Now, Ms Whaitiri has informed the public that she wrote to you, and, on the face of it, that would meet the terms of section 55B. If that were not the case, I wonder if you could inform the House whether a written notice wasn't received, and if it was received, what about sections 55A, 55B, and 55C were not met that meant that that vacation wasn't triggered? Thirdly, without wanting to cast any aspersions, I think this is an important constitutional matter, the like of which has not been tested since section 55 was amended in 2018. I wonder if you would consider tabling the correspondence that you received from Ms Whaitiri. ",3/05/2023 14:02
507,Speech,Speaker," Members will be well aware that any member can say anything they like outside of this Chamber. When it comes to, as the member has pointed out, sections 55A to 55E, then there's some very specific events that need to happen for me to declare a seat vacant. I can confirm to the House that those events have not happened, and I have therefore not done so.",3/05/2023 14:03
508,Speech,Michael Woodhouse," Speaking to that point, Mr Speaker. I accept that, and I'm certainly not wanting to challenge that. But I do think it is important, given that the intent of section 55A in substance was that when a member resigns from a parliamentary party and indicates to you, as she has, that she is now joining another political party in this House, that it behoves those parties to that correspondence to inform this Chamber how section 55A(2) is not invoked. I tread carefully for two reasons: one is that your decisions won't be challenged in that regard, but, secondly, this is a really, really important matter, and I'm not sure that we have yet had the full disclosure of what's actually transpired here. I accept the point that you make, that what Meka Whaitiri says outside this House does not count necessarily, but you yourself have acknowledged that that correspondence was received, but seemed to indicate that it was not in the form or of the substance that was described by Ms Whaitiri after she sent it to you. And I do think we need to traverse this—perhaps in more detail. ",3/05/2023 14:04
509,Speech,Grant Robertson," Speaking to the point of order. Thank you, Mr Speaker. The only point I wanted to add to from what the member just did is to make sure that we fully understand section 55A of the Electoral Act. While 55A(2), which the member alluded to, does state that the seat of the member becomes vacant under the circumstances he described, it is important to read that in the context of 53A(3), which says, ""For the purposes of subsection (2), a member of Parliament ceases to be a parliamentary member of the political party for which the member of Parliament was elected only if—"", and then goes through. So just the impression could have been gained, from what Mr Woodhouse just said, that subsection (2) stands alone—it doesn't. Subsection (3) is the determining factor of subsection (2).",3/05/2023 14:06
510,Speech,Michael Woodhouse," Speaking to that point. I accept that, and I think that was implied in what I had said, because section 55A(3)(a), basically, says that that only gets triggered if the member of Parliament delivers to the Speaker a written notice that complies with section 55B. What's not clear to me—or the House, I would expect—is whether or not that did not happen, or whether it didn't happen in a form commensurate with the requirements of section 55B.",3/05/2023 14:07
511,a,Michael Woodhouse,"I would also add this: I don't believe it was the Electoral Act's intention that the form of communication prevented the effect of the Act from being followed. So, essentially, what we may have is a situation where, because of paperwork, a person that has, in fact, resigned from a parliamentary political party and has joined another political party is nevertheless still able to maintain the seat, despite section 55A. Now, I'm not quite sure whether this is the right forum to have this litigated, but I do believe that the Chamber and the public have a right to understand exactly how the Electoral Act has been interpreted in this situation.",3/05/2023 14:07
512,Speech,Speaker," I think it would be a dangerous situation for the Speaker of the House to start interpreting things that clearly have not been officially submitted to me. Now, as I began my ruling, members can say whatever they like outside of this House, but unless they inform me in the correct way by sending me a signed letter that that is the case, I can't act on it, and I'm not prepared to do that until I get a letter signed by the member concerned that what she has said outside is her intention to do. ",3/05/2023 14:08
513,Interjection,Chris Bishop," Point or order, Mr Speaker. ",3/05/2023 14:08
514,ContinueSpeech,Speaker, Is this a new one? ,3/05/2023 14:08
515,Speech,Chris Bishop," Yeah, it's a very important point, sir, because section 53B puts out three requirements. One is that it has to be signed by the member of Parliament, and you've just stressed the word ""signature"" or ""signed"" a couple of times, which may be a giveaway. So could I ask you: is the issue that it was received electronically without an actual physical signature—which I think would be debatable, because it's a longstanding rule now that electronic signatures are available and emails can be, essentially, received electronically?",3/05/2023 14:09
516,a,Chris Bishop,The second point is that it has to be addressed to the Speaker. That seems like a matter of form. Is that the issue?,3/05/2023 14:09
517,a,Chris Bishop,"Then the third issue, sir, which I do think the House needs some ventilation on, is the issue of resignation from a parliamentary membership of a political party. Is it the case, sir, that something turns on the word ""parliamentary""? Members with long memories will remember the incident in 2002, when the Hon Jim Anderton resigned from the leadership of The Alliance Party but remained a parliamentary member of The Alliance Party for various parliamentary reasons. Are you, sir, drawing a distinction between Ms Whaitiri's membership of the Labour Party, in the incorporated society sense of membership, and membership of the Labour Party for political purposes, in a parliamentary sense? I know it sounds technical, but this is an important matter.",3/05/2023 14:09
518,Speech,Speaker," To the first part, I can confirm to the House that I have not received any letter of resignation, signed or unsigned, OK? So that's the first part. What I have received—[Interruption] This is important, OK? So interrupting while I'm making a ruling—you might find it funny, but this is a serious issue. What I have been advised by an—before I say this, actually, I believe I follow the law to the letter, and so when I tell this House that I do not have a letter, I actually mean it: I don't. What I have got is an indication from the Hon Meka Whaitiri that for parliamentary purposes, she has withdrawn her vote with the Labour Party, which, under Standing Order 144 and Standing Order 145, any member can do that, and therefore she is no longer voting with the Labour Party, and she can, as any member can, give her proxy vote to whomever she likes.",3/05/2023 14:10
519,Speech,Michael Woodhouse," Last question, Mr Speaker, if you'll indulge me—well, it's two. Was that communication in writing, and, secondly, was a letter—paper or electronic—sent to your office that was subsequently withdrawn?",3/05/2023 14:12
520,Speech,Speaker, I have received the letter—the email that I spoke about—asking for her vote to be withdrawn. That was received by email.,3/05/2023 14:12
521,Speech,David Seymour," Can you, please, just clarify: do you regard Meka Whaitiri as being a member of the parliamentary Labour Party or not? Now, I apologise if you feel you've addressed that, but I think it would be helpful for everyone to understand what your position is on that question. And, if the answer is no, then I don't really see how a vacancy cannot be created. If you could just answer that question, it would be very helpful to know.",3/05/2023 14:12
522,Speech,Speaker," It's really not for me to determine who is in which party. For whatever reason she has made that decision to write to me to withdraw her proxy is entirely up to her. That does not mean to say that I can interpret that she has left the Labour Party, but this is for parliamentary purposes.",3/05/2023 14:13
523,Speech,Chris Bishop," Point of order. Quite a lot flows from this, Mr Speaker. In the interpretation of the allocation of supplementary questions and oral questions, as part of the rota, which is done proportionally, will the Hon Meka Whaitiri be regarded as a Māori Party MP for the purposes of oral and supplementary questions, and the general debate determination?",3/05/2023 14:14
524,Speech,Speaker, She'll be regarded as an Independent member for those purposes.,3/05/2023 14:14
525,Speech,David Seymour," Speaking to that, if she's regarded as an Independent member, that can only come as an effect of her communications with you. And, if she's given you a communication that can have that effect, how can it possibly not also create a vacancy?",3/05/2023 14:14
526,Speech,Grant Robertson," Speaking to the point of order. I'd just refer that member to what you did, which is Standing Orders 144 and 145. Standing Orders there are with respect to votes that are held in this House. Communications about that are not the same as communications about the Electoral Act.",3/05/2023 14:15
527,Speech,Michael Woodhouse," Perhaps, actually, I should just preface my question with saying that these questions might go away if the communication was released. But my question is: given your answer—",3/05/2023 14:15
528,Interjection,Grant Robertson, You're questioning the Speaker.,3/05/2023 14:15
529,ContinueSpeech,Michael Woodhouse," No, and I have prefaced every single comment about that with a clarification that that's absolutely not what I'm doing. But, Mr Speaker, you have just said that Meka Whaitiri wishes to be recognised for parliamentary purposes as an Independent member of Parliament. And that can only happen if she has resigned from the parliamentary Labour Party, and therefore it is, I think, worth considering, whether it's here or somewhere else, whether section 55B(c)(ii) has been met and, if that was inside a communication to you and signed by the member, I think there is still an open question about whether section 55A(2) has also been triggered.",3/05/2023 14:15
530,Speech,Speaker," The law as currently drafted allows no judgment at all to be exercised by the Speaker. A vacancy can only be declared if notice is given in a specific and correct way to the Speaker. That, as I have said now three times, has not happened.",3/05/2023 14:16
531,Interjection,Gerry Brownlee," Point of order, Mr Speaker. ",3/05/2023 14:16
532,ContinueSpeech,Speaker, A new point of order? ,3/05/2023 14:16
533,Interjection,Gerry Brownlee, Yeah. ,3/05/2023 14:16
534,ContinueSpeech,Speaker, The Hon Gerry Brownlee. ,3/05/2023 14:16
535,Speech,Gerry Brownlee," Mr Speaker, doesn't that raise the question of why you were able to make the judgment that the member is now an Independent? The two Standing Orders that were quoted by Mr Robertson relate to persons who have given their proxy or who are part of a caucus. Once you withdraw from a caucus—then if you are not able to make a judgment, why are you able to stand in the House today and declare that Ms Whaitiri will be an Independent member? ",3/05/2023 14:17
536,Speech,Speaker," I thank the member for his question. It's entirely up to the member themselves. As I've said already, I'm not making a judgment on which party that the member is part of—that's not my role. As I said in previous rulings, the Act is very clear, and until I have got a letter stating that the member has resigned under that section, then she is still a member of Parliament. ",3/05/2023 14:17
537,Speech,Gerry Brownlee," Speaking to the point of order, Mr Speaker. Thank you for that clarification, sir. Then why are you able to make a determination that the allocation of parliamentary time will be removed from the Labour Party and given to the Independent member, when that would seem to contravene all of the intentions of the two Standing Orders raised by Mr Robertson? ",3/05/2023 14:18
538,Speech,Speaker," Regardless of the way that the Hon Meka Whaitiri has advised both the public, the Labour Party, or anyone else about anything that she's doing, she has not notified me. So she can, as a member of this House, tell me that her proxy vote is not with the Labour Party now, as I've said before, and, for parliamentary purposes, that she is regarded as an Independent member of Parliament. ",3/05/2023 14:19
539,Speech,Chris Bishop," Point of order, Mr Speaker. Well, this is difficult, because if she is regarded by you as an Independent member, which you have said that she is, she has fulfilled and she has told—like, you can't regard her as an Independent member unless she has told you something. ",3/05/2023 14:20
540,Interjection,Speaker, Only for parliamentary purposes. ,3/05/2023 14:20
541,ContinueSpeech,Chris Bishop," Well, if she is regarded as an Independent member of Parliament and you've indicated that for the purposes of the allocation of supplementaries, etc., she will be regarded as an Independent member of Parliament, in a parliamentary sense she has fulfilled section 55B. She has notified you—by definition, she must have notified you, because you've just indicated you're regarding her as that. She has fulfilled section 55B, which therefore triggers the rest of the Act, and the seat is vacated. I'm struggling to see how you can regard her as an Independent member if for voting purposes and for proportionality purposes she is not regarded as a member of the Labour Party any more, she can be an Independent member of Parliament in this House, and that not trigger the Electoral Act. Parliament explicitly changed the law back in 2018 to make it so that in those circumstances, those members of Parliament who do that, who distort the proportionality of Parliament by leaving the political party with which they were elected—and leaving aside the merits of whether or not that was a good idea to do it or not, the law is the law. ",3/05/2023 14:20
542,Speech,David Seymour," Speaking to the point of order, Mr Speaker. Would this whole matter not be so much simpler if you simply retracted your statement that she is an Independent member and instead said that she remains a member of the parliamentary Labour Party who has decided to have her proxy vote exercised independent of that party?

543,Speech,Grant Robertson," Speaking to that point of order. Just on that very specific point, it is a very longstanding convention that it is members of this House that decide their vote, and members of this House, as is covered by the Standing Orders we've been discussing before, who can indicate, at any given moment, who is casting their vote. So the way round that the member put it would not be consistent with where we are. It is up to a member of Parliament to indicate that. I'm not going into the other bit, but on that piece, it would be that way round, not the other way round.",3/05/2023 14:22
544,Speech,James Shaw," Speaking to the point of order, Mr Speaker. Thank you. I mean, the confusion here, I think, is that when you look at the purpose of the bill, it says that it provides for a member to vacate their seat in Parliament if they choose to give notice to the Speaker of their ceasing parliamentary membership of the party for which they were elected. So is it our understanding that she has not ceased to be a member of the parliamentary Labour Party but that she has withdrawn her vote from the parliamentary Labour Party? Is that what we're being told?",3/05/2023 14:22
545,Speech,Speaker," Yeah; there are several different issues going on, and a lot of them are repeating or asking the same thing that I've already answered. For parliamentary purposes, the Hon Meka Whaitiri being an Independent MP is a determination under the Standing Orders. She has not told me that she is an Independent MP, but for the purposes of Parliament, I have notified the House that she has asked me and informed me that she has withdrawn her proxy from the Labour Party and she wishes to sit somewhere else. That's it.",3/05/2023 14:23

In considering the application for an urgent debate, while there is ministerial responsibility, it is also relevant whether there are other parliamentary means of debating the subject.

The term of the authority's present chairperson, Judge Colin Doherty, expired on 29 August 2022. However, his appointment remained in force under carry-over provisions. Judge Doherty did not seek reappointment for a further term, but agreed to continue in office to oversee the completion of several high-profile investigations.

596,Speech,Michael Woodhouse," Point of order, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I raise an issue with you under Standing Order 267 relating to the Severe Weather Emergency Legislation Bill which, as you know, is an omnibus bill being passaged through the House tomorrow afternoon. I would ask for your considered ruling by 2 o'clock tomorrow—clause 14 of that bill seeks to amend part of the Local Government Act to reconcile issues relating to long-term planning with the new water services entities. Now, Standing Order 267 requires that omnibus bills deal with interrelated topics that amend separate bills, and my submission to you is that the amendment in clause 14 is not related to cyclone recovery. Indeed, a number of district councils, including Horowhenua and Gisborne pointed out to the select committee considering the two subsequent water services entities bills, the Finance and Expenditure Committee, that this was an anomaly and they recommended amending those clauses.",15/03/2023 14:47
597,a,Michael Woodhouse,"So we have something of a dilemma, because—well, two things: firstly, you have the power to disallow a clause before a bill is introduced, but it would be unfair to consider that you would know everything about every bill, that's just not realistic. What we have is a situation where the bill has had its first reading, has gone to the Governance and Administration Committee today, but it appears that the Standing Orders are silent on what to do about a clause in a bill that, in my view, is in clear opposition to the requirements of Standing Order 267. Now, the committee will meet this afternoon and may have a resolution, but I'm not that confident. So I'd like you to consider and rule, as can be the case in the committee of the whole House for new amendments, that clause 14 should be removed from this bill. We have worked very, I think, constructively to get the emergency legislation through, and it would be a shame if this was sort of an irritant on that process. There are also other places, including those two bills, where the fix could be made. We have urgency on the week of 28 March, we have Budget urgency coming up, there are other places that this remedy could be achieved. But I don't think this is within either the spirit or the letter of Standing Orders.",15/03/2023 14:47
598,Speech,Kieran Mcanulty," Speaking to the point of order. Thank you, Mr Speaker. In response to that, the rationale behind the inclusion was included in the introductory speech yesterday. We outlined that, at the request of local government, they would like this provision included so that they can make investments in water service infrastructure to repair that damaged by the cyclone. Also, other councils have requested it so that they can make investments for resilience, which has arisen as a major focus as a result of the damage from the cyclone. ",15/03/2023 14:51
599,Speech,Michael Woodhouse," Speaking to that point. I thank the Minister and I certainly wouldn't want to imply—because he did mention it in the first reading—that this was being done by stealth. The really key point here, though, is that the changes being made by the bill are for affected regions which are named in the bill. The amendment of clause 14 will affect all 80-odd councils across the country and are irrespective of and not related to cyclone recovery.",15/03/2023 14:51
600,Speech,Kieran Mcanulty," So that also applies to other changes proposed in the bill related to the Local Government Act, including the allowance for those attending meetings via Zoom or other virtual means to be considered a quorum. That also applies to all councils, not just those affected by the cyclone.",15/03/2023 14:51
601,Speech,David Seymour," Speaking to the point of order. If I can help, Mr Speaker. All laws apply equally to all people, that's one of the main principles of lawmaking. So it's hardly a surprise that in pursuing the purpose of this bill, some other councils might be affected as well. I frankly don't see what the discussions about.",15/03/2023 14:51
602,Speech,Speaker," Can I thank the Hon Michael Woodhouse for raising this issue and giving time for me to be advised by the Clerk of the House. I've thought carefully about it and am prepared to make a ruling right now. Normally I would not entertain a point of order relating to proceedings of a bill before select committee. However, given the very short time frame for the passage of the Severe Weather Emergency Legislation Bill, I am prepared to consider it. The Speaker scrutinises bills at introduction for compliance with the rules for omnibus bills and may take steps at that stage to ensure a bill complies with the rule Standing Order 265. I may not take these steps at a later stage except in relation to out of order amendments. If members do not think that provisions of a bill meet the test for permitted types of omnibus bills, that is something for them to test with officials advising the select committee, and then with the Minister in committee of the whole House. Ultimately, they may vote accordingly.",15/03/2023 14:52
603,Speech,Speaker," Members, I have received a letter from the Hon Mark Mitchell seeking to debate under Standing Order 399 an allegation of interference in a police prosecution. The making of allegations is not a particular case for which there is a ministerial responsibility—Speaker's rulings 201/2 and 205/6. If Mr Mitchell wishes to pursue his allegations then the appropriate mechanism is through parliamentary questions. Therefore, the application is denied.",15/03/2023 14:53

An application for urgent debate can be lodged up to the time the House sits. This application was received at 2.14 p.m. and is therefore declined. If something occurs after the time the House sits, the application can be lodged for consideration on the next sitting day, so that's still available.",15/03/2023 14:53
605,Speech,David Seymour," Point of order, Mr Speaker. I also submitted a letter much earlier today. It would seem that you are not considering that letter because you have preferred my later one, even though my later one was invalid, which seems that if you rejected the acceptance of my later letter at 2.14 p.m., you should go back to considering my first one.",15/03/2023 14:54

609,ContinueSpeech,David Seymour," That may be so, however that was on the basis that Standing Order 399 says the Speaker can use their judgment to accept a letter.

613,Interjection,Member, He still is.,15/03/2023 14:56
614,ContinueSpeech,Chris Bishop," Well, he still is a Minister, but he was still Minister of Police at the time. But public coverage of the incident that I think we're all referring to referred to allegations. Now, you have ruled—fair enough—that allegations are not a matter of ministerial business and therefore can't be subject to an urgent debate. Mr Nash has now resigned as a Minister, and I put it to you that it is in the public interest that notwithstanding that happened after 2.00 p.m., which is to comply with Standing Order 399, letters have to be in by that time. I put it to you that it is clearly in the public interest, and I ask you to use your discretion to order an urgent debate forthwith.",15/03/2023 14:56
615,Intervention,Speaker," I'll go back to my original ruling. It was based on the information on the second application that the first one was removed. If it had not been removed, I would have made the same ruling that I made on the Hon Mark Mitchell's application.",15/03/2023 14:56
616,Speech,David Seymour, Point of order.,15/03/2023 14:57
617,Speech,Speaker, Is it a new point of order?,15/03/2023 14:57
618,ContinueSpeech,David Seymour," Well, there is a genuine problem here that you've refused to consider the first letter on the basis of the second one that you ruled wasn't submitted in time, so you can't count it.",15/03/2023 14:57
619,Speech,Speaker," No, that's not—",15/03/2023 14:57
620,ContinueSpeech,David Seymour," So you count my second letter for the basis of nullifying my first one, but not for the basis of actually considering it, which, if you had, you almost would have certainly granted, because it's a resignation of a Minister. So there is a logical problem here where there is no logical way that a member in my position can actually have their debate considered.",15/03/2023 14:57
621,Intervention,Speaker," Well, basically what I'm ruling is that a member can withdraw the application at any time up until I've made the ruling. Now, in my mind, that has been done.",15/03/2023 14:57
622,ContinueSpeech,David Seymour, You said it was too late.,15/03/2023 14:57
623,Intervention,Speaker," This will be the end if you keep interrupting me while I'm on my feet. That means that that application had been removed. The second application, as I ruled, is declined because it was after the time, but is still available. The issue is for the next sitting day.",15/03/2023 14:57

I wish to draw members' attention to Speaker's ruling 163/4-5. Speaker Smith ruled on this matter when a Minister was asked about a decision that occurred in his portfolio before he became a Minister. Dr Smith ruled that ""Just because a Minister may not have been present at the time does not relieve them of being answerable for what took place.""

626,Speech,Tangi Utikere," Point of order. Thank you Mr Speaker. I think members will be aware that the bells which usually ring to allow members to make their way to the House did not occur this afternoon.

631,a,Grant Robertson,"It's been agreed by the Business Committee that this will be the only speech on this motion. Its purpose is to briefly explain the process behind the appointment. The Parliamentary Service Commission was created by the Parliamentary Service Act 2000 to be the main source of advice to the Speaker on the nature of services to be provided to the House and its members, and on directions relating to the allocation and administration of funding. The membership of the commission is determined by the Act. It consists of the Speaker, the Leader of the House, the Leader of the Opposition or their nominee, and an additional member of each party represented in the House, nominated by motion—but no Minister can be nominated as one of these additional members. By convention, the second representative of the leading Government party is the senior whip, which brings me to the nomination of Tangi Utikere.",8/03/2023 19:25
632,a,Grant Robertson,"Tangi was elected as the member of Parliament for Palmerston North in 2020, but he had a life prior to that. He served a term as the Deputy Mayor of Palmerston North, a job highly sought after across the land, and one that he fulfilled to a very, very high standard. As his colleagues can attest, his experience as a teacher at Freyberg High School certainly comes in handy in the role of Government whip, as I'm sure the Opposition whips would indicate too. He has already proved himself in the role to be effective and efficient—and efficient and efficient!—and he is a person who has shown that not only through his role as a whip but also in his chairpersonship of the Health Committee.",8/03/2023 19:25
633,a,Grant Robertson,"I was informed earlier today of two things about Mr Utikere that I didn't know. The first of those is that he is a marriage celebrant. So should there be anyone around the place looking for somebody to do that for them, I'm sure Tangi would be very, very obliging in that regard. The second was from an informant who shall remain unnamed, Rachel Boyack, who attended Ross Intermediate School in Palmerston North with Mr Utikere several years ago—we won't say how many that was—who informs me that her memory of Mr Utikere was that he was ""The one who was always called up to thank the visitors who came to the school."" And that, fellow members of Parliament, tells you all you need to know about the kind of person that Tangi Utikere is. He will be a valuable source of wisdom and advice as a member of the Parliamentary Service Commission, and I commend this motion to the House.",8/03/2023 19:25

670,a,Hon Grant Robertson,"The heartbreaking images we see on television on screens and social media show with alarming clarity the level of devastation that has been caused in Türkiye and Syria. The human cost is staggering. In Türkiye, authorities have declared that more than 31,000 people have lost their lives. In Syria, the picture is less clear, but more than 4,500 deaths have been reported. These incredibly distressing figures will, sadly, continue to climb.",14/02/2023 14:03
671,a,Hon Grant Robertson,"The scale and magnitude of the destruction caused by the earthquakes is enormous. Across the two countries, thousands of buildings have collapsed, and many more have been partially destroyed. Delivering relief efforts across such a huge scale is incredibly difficult, particularly when so much infrastructure—such as airports, roads, and viaducts—has also been damaged. These circumstances are, sadly, compounded by the harsh challenges of winter, with many of those left homeless now braving the elements in freezing temperatures and snow.",14/02/2023 14:03
672,a,Hon Grant Robertson,"Last week, New Zealand announced financial support, totalling $4.5 million, towards the response on the ground in Türkiye and Syria. This support includes $1.5 million to support the Turkish Red Crescent and Syrian Arab Red Crescent, $2 million to be delivered through the World Food Programme in Türkiye, and $1 million to support the UNICEF response in Syria. In addition to financial support, two Fire and Emergency New Zealand specialists are providing remote support to the search and rescue efforts from New Zealand, as part of a connected global team. Fire and Emergency New Zealand is obviously responding to ongoing domestic emergencies in New Zealand, including Cyclone Gabrielle, so we are pleased that they are able to contribute to this international effort as well.",14/02/2023 14:03

This is especially so given our own experience of living through significant earthquakes.

676,Speech,Kieran Mcanulty, I wish to make a ministerial statement under Standing Order 364 in relation to the recent declaration of a state of national emergency.,14/02/2023 14:17
677,a,Kieran Mcanulty,"On the advice of the Director of Civil Defence Emergency Management, and in consultation with the Prime Minister, I declared a state of national emergency under section 66 of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 on Tuesday, 14 February 2023, at 8.43 a.m. for the following civil defence emergency management group areas: Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Tai Rāwhiti, and Hawke's Bay. I also declared a state of national emergency for the Tararua district, allowing it to be included within the nationally coordinated response. This is to manage the impacts of Cyclone Gabrielle across the North Island. I took this step because the impacts from Cyclone Gabrielle are of such a degree that the civil defence emergency management necessary, or desirable, is, or will likely be, beyond the resources of the impacted civil defence emergency management groups. This event also requires a significant and coordinated response by and across central and local government.",14/02/2023 14:17
678,a,Kieran Mcanulty,"This has been an exceptionally tough time for people across Aotearoa, in our cities, towns, and rural communities. Our thoughts are with those across New Zealand who are being impacted by Cyclone Gabrielle, and I particularly acknowledge those across the north and east of the North Island who are experiencing the compounding effects of multiple severe weather events over this summer.",14/02/2023 14:17

680,a,Kieran Mcanulty,"I'd like to recognise the extraordinary efforts of emergency management staff, emergency services, volunteers, and iwi, community and rural leaders across the regions, and say thank you on behalf of all New Zealanders. Even though national coordination is now in place, the response has been, and continues to be, led at a local and regional level through civil defence emergency management groups.",14/02/2023 14:17
681,a,Kieran Mcanulty,"Cyclone Gabrielle has already led to many thousands of homes being without power at times during the storm, and further outages are possible. We are also seeing evacuations in multiple regions, landslips, road closures, surface flooding, and flight and train cancellations.",14/02/2023 14:17
682,a,Kieran Mcanulty,"We aren't out of the woods yet. Forecasts show that the North Island will continue to experience severe weather today before easing on Wednesday and Thursday. I am heartened by the images of community members showing such great support for one another. Many evacuated residents are staying with friends or family, and marae have played a valuable role by opening their doors to those who need support.",14/02/2023 14:17
683,a,Kieran Mcanulty,"I also want to acknowledge all members in this House, from all parties, who have worked hard on behalf of their constituents during this time. For those parties outside of Government, thank you for working constructively with agencies and Ministers on behalf of your constituents. I particularly want to acknowledge the Hon Gerry Brownlee for his support and guidance throughout this time. There's no time for political games at times like this, and you've lived up to that. So thank you.",14/02/2023 14:17
684,a,Kieran Mcanulty,"The National Emergency Management Agency's national coordination centre has been activated since 27 January in support of the upper North Island flooding response and now Cyclone Gabrielle. Over the past week, hundreds of staff from the emergency services, the New Zealand Defence Force, the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Ministry for Social Development, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Waka Kotahi, Te Puni Kōkiri, as well as the National Emergency Management Agency, and civil defence and emergency management (CDEM) groups have been on the ground across all affected areas.",14/02/2023 14:17

At least 137 civil defence centres, marae, and other community centres have been stood up across the country.",14/02/2023 14:17
686,a,Kieran Mcanulty,"Welfare and infrastructure needs are likely to increase as the full extent of the damage becomes clearer. The Government will ensure welfare services are available to help people with their needs. This is being delivered across the regions affected—and, again, local marae are supporting the delivery in multiple ways, such as providing additional shelter locations for displaced people. To date, over $14 million in civil defence payments have also been provided by the Ministry of Social Development to just under 27,000 people in need since the Auckland flooding of 27 January.",14/02/2023 14:17
687,a,Kieran Mcanulty,"This is only the third time in New Zealand's history that a state of national emergency has been declared under our civil defence and emergency management legislation. The first was on 23 February 2011, following the 6.3 magnitude earthquake in Christchurch. The second was declared on 25 March 2020, owing to the impact of COVID-19 on New Zealand. The state of national emergency will be in place for a period of seven days, unless extended or terminated early. If the need for central government coordination becomes clear in other regions, these may also be brought in to the nationally coordinated response.",14/02/2023 14:17
688,a,Kieran Mcanulty,"Under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002, today's state of national emergency declaration means the Director of Civil Defence Emergency Management may control the performance of functions, duties, and powers of civil defence emergency management groups and group controllers in those areas. While in force, it will allow the national controller—in addition to CDEM group level controllers—to conserve and supply food, fuel, and other essential supplies; close roads and public places; evacuate any premises, including a public place; requisition property, including any land, building, vehicle, animal, equipment, materials, or supplies; direct persons to stop any activity that may cause or substantially contribute to an emergency; and undertake works—for example, earthworks, required for stabilising land and property. This declaration gives us the legal authority to coordinate and prioritise resources at a national level to ensure they get where they are most needed. ",14/02/2023 14:17
689,a,Kieran Mcanulty,"Soon, the Government will begin turning its attention to how it can support the recovery. The Government is strongly committed to supporting the regions as they recover from damage caused by the cyclone. We can expect the recovery to be long and complex in many areas, and we'll assess these needs once the full extent of damage is known. For now, our focus is on continuing to support the response as Cyclone Gabrielle passes. We will continue to work with the regions to identify needs and provide any further support needed.",14/02/2023 14:17
690,a,Kieran Mcanulty,"Mr Speaker, I know that you and members across the House will join me in expressing our support and aroha to those impacted by this unprecedented emergency event, and gratitude to those—often personally affected themselves—who have risen to the needs of the situation to support their communities at this time.

They are fantastic advocates, they are incredible representatives of their communities, and I personally feel so well supported by each and every one of them. I thought the Deputy Prime Minister was taking it a bit far, though, when he took to standing every time I came into a room, until I realised he had actually slipped a disc. But that is indicative of the way in which many of our members have conducted themselves, putting themselves on the line at every single stage—Jamie Strange, sitting with his leg propped up in a brace, phone-calling with Georgie Dansey, our candidate who had dislocated her shoulder door-knocking. Literally, these MPs will give it their all, and I thank you—each and every one of you—for that.",14/12/2022 15:51
708,a,Jacinda Ardern (Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"As we come to the end of 2022, it would be fair to assume that the world has almost spun off its axis. We are still dealing with the impact of a pandemic as it moves from a health crisis on to being an economic one, we lost our head of State, war broke out in Ukraine, the climate crisis continues to confront us, and there was a punch-up at the Oscars. And while the magnitude of all of those events is of course vastly different, they all speak to one theme: this year has been hard. And while politics is always about solving problems, there's never been quite so many problems presenting themselves all at once, very loudly, very impatiently—like an open bar at a parliamentary dinner break. And when faced with problems like that in politics, you have four choices. Those choices are: you can ignore them; you can blame someone else for them and then ignore them; or the National party's preferred option, create the problems, ignore them, and then blame someone else for them; or you can do something about it. And I'm proud that this Government has never shied away from taking on issues, addressing problems that others would ignore for political expediency, finally resolving, for instance, persistent under-investment in this country.",14/12/2022 15:51
709,a,Jacinda Ardern (Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"That is why, over the course of this year and, indeed, over the course of this term, we have ticked off some major reform. We're reforming the Resource Management Act to make our planning system faster, cheaper, and better—and I acknowledge you, Minister Parker, for the huge amount of work that has gone into that. We've taken on decade-old infrastructure problems—that is not a metaphor for having a debate with Damien O'Connor. We introduced fair pay agreements to make sure workers in the most vulnerable sectors get the pay and conditions they deserve without a race to the bottom. ",14/12/2022 15:51

711,a,Jacinda Ardern (Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"We've shaken up our health system, introducing Health New Zealand to make sure that the healthcare you receive isn't based on where you live. We've increased Pharmac funding by 43 percent. We've kept rebuilding our health workforce, including hiring over 4,200 more nurses. ",14/12/2022 15:51
712,a,Jacinda Ardern (Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"We've worked on our skills gap, and productivity issues, with nearly 250,000 people in trades training. Minister Hipkins has been busy, and some might say the similarities to Steve Maharey are uncanny. We have supported our exporters to build in greater resilience, with new trade agreements set to cover almost 75 percent of our exports, and we reached No. 1 on the Sustainable Trade Index. ",14/12/2022 15:51
713,a,Jacinda Ardern (Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"While addressing these persistent issues, we've also supported Kiwis through what has been an incredibly tough time and a cost of living crisis, with increases to the family tax credit, the introduction of the cost of living payment, and easing pressure at the pump. We've expanded childcare subsidies and, of course, halved the cost of public transport, and while we don't know what 2023 will bring, we are ready for what will come our way, because we knew COVID would carry an economic price, and we prepared for it. ",14/12/2022 15:51
714,a,Jacinda Ardern (Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"But while we're ready, I will also concede that with a busy year does come the need for a bit of a break, and a word of thanks. And so, then, to all those who work so hard to support all of us, I take this opportunity on behalf of the Labour Party to thank the many people who have supported each and every one of us.",14/12/2022 15:51
715,a,Jacinda Ardern (Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"Let me start with our electorate office teams. They do incredible work. They are our faces when we are not in our offices, and it is fair to say that in recent times they have faced greater antagonism. They do it with a smile and with a focus on service, and I know we'd all wish to acknowledge them. ",14/12/2022 15:51

717,a,Jacinda Ardern (Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"Our executive support team: the sign language interpreters, who are so patient on a Monday afternoon waiting for that post-Cabinet script that comes five minutes before delivery—they are always here, ensuring that all New Zealanders hear our messages, our debate, our kōrero—the IT and sound technicians, the press gallery.

To all of you—to all of you—I say thank you, and I wish you a wonderful break.",14/12/2022 15:51
719,a,Jacinda Ardern (Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"I want to finish by ending with a memory that will be a highlight for me this year. We're always asked, ""What were your highs and what were your lows?"" Politics is about addressing problems, but sometimes it is also about progress too. One of my abiding memories of this year will be standing on the balcony at Te Papa on a morning that I can only describe as a fresh morning, to welcome in the Māori New Year. This is not a new event or occasion for many, but it was the first time we marked it as a nation together. As I saw people gathered together on the forecourt of that place and then congregating later that evening for the many fireworks displays that occurred around the country, including here in Wellington, it felt like we were both taking a moment of pause in a long journey that is building and recognising our unique place in this world and who we are as people.",14/12/2022 15:51
720,a,Jacinda Ardern (Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"So, as we close out the year, my final reflection is this: we are an amazing country on a journey. We have faced our fair share of challenges, but we rise to them every time and we keep making progress. And next year, we will do the same; 2023 is full of uncertainty, but we know enough about our position and our resolve to know we will come through stronger than most—and we will, and continue to have, a focus on our people throughout. As we launch into 2023 clear-eyed on what lies ahead, I can assure you, you will have a team on this side of the House that has never lost sight, and will never lose sight, of why we are here and who we are here for, and who has never ever shied away from a challenge, whether our bodies are broken or not. But for now, to every New Zealander and to every member of Parliament in this House, I wish you all a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year. Kia ora.",14/12/2022 15:51

751,Speech,Eugenie Sage," Tēnā koe, Mr Speaker. I move, That the House take note of the Environment Committee's report on the Emissions budgets published in 2022, and the first emissions reduction plan. ",17/11/2022 15:09
752,a,Eugenie Sage,"Any debate and discussion on how we best protect the planet and the future of humanity by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to prevent global temperatures rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius is timely, especially this week, with COP27 happening in Egypt, and I'm pleased to speak to and introduce the Environment Committee's report. The committee was tasked with examining the emissions budgets by the Standing Orders. We also decided to examine the emissions reduction plan (ERP), as it provides a basis for the emissions budgets for the 2022 to 2025, 2026 to 2030, and 2031 to 2035 periods. ",17/11/2022 15:09
753,a,Eugenie Sage,"We did that examination over five months and, as always, public submissions were important. I acknowledge the 64 individuals and organisations who made submissions and those we heard from in person. Can I also thank, on behalf of the committee, our two independent advisers, Matthew Cowie and Andrew McMillan, and the Ministry for the Environment (MFE) for the advice that they provided. I'd also like to acknowledge the work of officials across the public sector in developing the emissions reduction plan and the contribution which the Productivity Commission and the Climate Change Commission made to that. ",17/11/2022 15:09
754,a,Eugenie Sage,"I also thank the secretariat for the select committee, who do a lot of work to ensure that our discussions are here in clear and cogent reports, and that 35-page report is, I think, a useful summary of the framework for climate action in Aotearoa New Zealand, the role of emissions budgets as steps towards our two key 2050 targets of getting a 24 to 47 percent reduction in biogenic methane emissions by 2050, and of having net zero emissions for all other greenhouse gases. It also provides a summary of how the emissions trading scheme (ETS) works and some of the issues in sectors such as agriculture, transport, energy, and waste, which are all major sources of emissions. ",17/11/2022 15:09
755,a,Eugenie Sage,"The committee's examination is, I think, part of an iterative process. It will contribute to the development, we hope, of the next emissions budgets and the next emissions reduction plan, and we certainly identified areas where there could be more attention by agencies. ",17/11/2022 15:09
756,a,Eugenie Sage,"Just speaking briefly on a couple of the themes in the report, one was about empowering Māori, because submitters sought more information about the Māori climate platform to support communications to Māori communities so that they are able to better plan and respond to climate change and ensure that there was a Māori lens across Government's response to reducing emissions, and also to embed that whole Māori-Crown partnership, Te Tiriti principles, and representation of Te Ao Māori across the Government's climate policy. One of the other key themes was the need for an equitable response and for fully informed public participation in policy development, and the need to ensure that our climate policies benefit disadvantaged communities, whether that's in urban development or transport—ensuring that people with disability have better access to urban areas and to public transport, for example. MFE said that one of the critical actions here around public information is, potentially, the establishment of a climate information centre as a source of trusted advice to the public. ",17/11/2022 15:09
757,a,Eugenie Sage,"There was quite a bit of discussion about the role of cost-benefit analysis: the recognition that that happens as part of the Budget process, but it doesn't always happen on other policies. The committee highlighted the need to ensure, as the emissions reduction plan actions are implemented, how we best assess how effective they are in reducing emissions and how we can help shift people to a low-emissions economy and relative value for money. ",17/11/2022 15:09
758,a,Eugenie Sage,"We need a well-coordinated, wide range of climate policies alongside the ETS in order to reduce emissions, and there was discussion in the report too of additionality, or what additional effect do policies have in reducing emissions. The committee considered that this was a key part of the future ERPs and the policy debate around those, looking at that issue of additionality. ",17/11/2022 15:09
759,a,Eugenie Sage,"If I can now speak as a Green MP, rather than as chair of the select committee, there is no doubt that the emissions reduction plan, with its 300 actions, is a landmark document. It builds on the Green Party's work in Government. It's a blueprint to cut climate pollution in a way that makes life better for everyone, that protects nature, and that improves our communities, but the pace of change is too slow. As the United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, said recently—and I quote—""We are in the fight of our lives. And we are losing."" Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing, global temperatures keep rising, and our planet is fast approaching tipping points that make climate chaos irreversible. ",17/11/2022 15:09
760,a,Eugenie Sage,"We need more clean energy, we need faster and more substantial cuts to agricultural pollution and transport pollution, and we need more public transport, safer options to get around our cities and towns on bike and by walking, a thriving natural environment, and the creation of thousands of new jobs, and yet at the very moment we need to accelerate efforts to build this better future, the National Party cannot even get its U-turns right on climate policy. When they go from not being able to correctly tell people which climate policy they're going to rip up today—because, for the first time ever, we have a clear plan to cut climate pollution which is being paid for by polluters, and it's only happened because we've got a Green climate change Minister working alongside Labour colleagues. ",17/11/2022 15:09
761,a,Eugenie Sage,"With the clock ticking, the worst possible outcome that I can imagine from the election next year is a National-ACT Government, because people want a secure future, they want a habitable planet, they want clean, renewable energy, they want warm, dry homes, and they want healthy nature. People want a Government that will do everything possible to safeguard their and their children's future and to ensure that we have a fair and equal society, which is exactly why we need more Green voices in Parliament and more Green voices in Government, pushing for more climate action that puts people and planet ahead of tax cuts and ahead of oil company profits. As the United Nations Secretary-General has said—and I quote—""We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator."" We need to accelerate our efforts to cut emissions in order to shift to that zero-carbon world—not obfuscation and delay. ",17/11/2022 15:09
762,a,Eugenie Sage,"There are often people, including some of the submitters, who seek delay. But, as Dr Rod Carr has so pertinently said, when people seek to delay by claiming that New Zealand's contribution is too small to make a difference because our emissions contribute 0.17 percent of the world's total gross emissions—what he says is, and I quote—""Every tonne emitted, whether it is from New Zealand or China, is seen by the planet as the same tonne."" So the action we take here in Aotearoa to reduce our emissions through implementing the emissions reduction plan is absolutely critical. ",17/11/2022 15:09
763,a,Eugenie Sage,"By taking action to reduce emissions to protect the planet, we can also tackle the cost of living crisis, because if we invest in public transport and if we invest in easier ways to get around our cities—as the emissions reduction plan sets out a road map for—we also reduce the impact of increasing prices of petrol from the war in Ukraine. We also reduce those costs of living pressures on households. If we invest in clean, renewable energy and in insulating homes, we reduce energy poverty and we tackle the cost of living impacts there, as well. ",17/11/2022 15:09
764,a,Eugenie Sage,"So this report canvasses some of those issues around the energy sector and the agricultural sector, and the efforts the Government is taking in the waste sector to reduce climate pollution. It is a plan for action. Submitters highlighted the need for Government to support action by individuals, and the report is a really good resource for anyone wanting to get a summary overview of action to protect the planet. Kia ora. ",17/11/2022 15:09
765,Speech,Speaker," Members, yesterday in question time, I committed to reviewing the exchange during question No. 7 to the Minister of Police regarding a reference to an alleged offence that, I understand, is currently before the courts, and to come back to the House on the intersection of the sub judice rule and the responsibility of Ministers to answer questions.",16/11/2022 14:01
766,a,Speaker,"I have now had time to review the Hansard, and can confirm that there is no change to the longstanding application of the sub judice rule in this House. References or analysis of the facts, or seeking opinions in respect of specific cases of alleged wrongdoing that are before the courts should be avoided. I will continue to be vigilant to ensure the House doesn't embark on questioning or debating those matters—Speaker's ruling 32/3. It may well be that members and the Speaker do not know that a certain issue is before the courts when they ask their question; in some cases, the Minister will know and may decide to refuse to answer questions about specific cases, on that basis. Further, a Minister may refuse to answer if they feel it is not in the public interest to do so, but, if that is the reason, they should say so.",16/11/2022 14:01
767,a,Speaker,"In the case of question No. 7 yesterday, I do not consider that the question would fall under the sub judice rule, as it only tangentially refers to victims of an alleged offence as individual business owners, like the business referred to. It did not ask about a specific alleged offence. The question was in respect of general Government policy on access to a programme or businesses that had been victimised once or multiple times. In fact, the Minister did answer the question when it was reworded immediately following, despite the member again referring to the victim of the alleged offence. ",16/11/2022 14:01
768,a,Speaker,"I am ruling that the Minister did have responsibility to answer the question about accessing the programme when it was first asked, but also that members, especially after they have been informed of a case before the courts, should take care when addressing broad policy issues and to do so without referring to those specific individual cases.",16/11/2022 14:01

775,a,Grant Robertson,"The final itself was an extraordinary game. It was a privilege to watch it at a sold-out Eden Park. The atmosphere was electric; and following on from the nail-biting semi-final the week before, it was another rollercoaster of emotions—a high-quality display of skills and athleticism in a pressure cooker environment from both teams. I want to acknowledge the England team for their superb display, not just in the final or even in the tournament, but in their 30-match unbeaten run that they had coming into the final.",15/11/2022 14:01
776,a,Grant Robertson,"The outpouring of emotion at the ground and in pubs, clubs, and homes all around New Zealand showed just how much the performances of the Black Ferns have brought our nation together.

777,a,Grant Robertson,"I want to acknowledge the whole Black Ferns squad, in particular co-captains Ruahei Demant and Kennedy Simon. This is not only a team of extraordinary athletes, they express themselves as great people connected to each other and their whānau and communities and as proud New Zealanders. The last year has been enormously challenging for the Black Ferns, and to come through and win this tournament is a testament to the character, resilience, and wairua of a group of wāhine toa. We salute them, one and all.",15/11/2022 14:01

I, too, want to acknowledge previous Black Ferns who have kept the flame alive when they did not have the support, resources, and recognition they deserve. Ngā mihi nui ki a koutou. To the team management—and in particular, the coaches: the Professor, Wayne Smith; Wesley Clarke; and Whitney Hansen—the heartfelt thanks of a nation.",15/11/2022 14:01

781,a,Grant Robertson,"We are proud of this team paving the way for women's sport in Aotearoa, proving that yet again it is something that we must support in further development. The Government is proud to have supported the tournament, alongside New Zealand Rugby, and to have invested to the tune of nearly $20 million in the tournament. We are also proud to have developed the first ever women and girls in sports strategy. That strategy gives us the long-term plan to give opportunities for young women and girls to participate, lead, thrive, be seen, and be heard when it comes to sport and recreation.",15/11/2022 14:01

784,Speech,Speaker," Members, the Electoral (Māori Electoral Option) Legislation Bill is on the Order Paper for consideration in committee. I would like to inform the House of my approach to the proposal contained in the bill for the amendment of a reserved provision. Clause 5 amends section 35 of the Electoral Act 1993, which is a reserved provision under section 268(1)(c) of that Act. During the committee stage, the question will be put separately on clause 5, and it will be agreed to only if the votes of 90 or more members are cast in favour of it. ",15/11/2022 14:17

786,a,Speaker,"The Speaker ensures the House meets legal requirements that apply to it. Where there is doubt about how the law should be applied in such cases, the Speaker will tend to prefer the approach that is least likely to give rise to judicial consideration of whether the law has been validly made. I say this as an aside, because in this case it is clear that clause 5 is a proposal to amend a reserved provision, and the special majority is needed for it to pass.",15/11/2022 14:17

789,ContinueSpeech,Andrew Little," Last week, in answer to a question, I stated that 1,266 internationally qualified nurses had arrived in New Zealand since 1 January this year. In preparation for today's question time, I'm now advised that that number should have been 1,231. I have advised Dr Shane Reti, who has a question in today's question time, and so he is aware of that change. ",15/11/2022 14:21
790,Speech,Shanan Halbert," I move, That the House take note of the report on the inquiry into congestion pricing in Auckland.",10/11/2022 14:58
791,a,Shanan Halbert,"Auckland's population is projected to rise to 2 million by early next decade. In order to move 2 million people around our largest city safely and efficiently, we need well-planned, connected infrastructure. As the member of Parliament for Northcote and someone who literally lives and breathes Tāmaki-makau-rau Auckland, I hear daily the urgency to address congestion, to unblock our roads, to give time back to families, while alleviating mental health pressures and supporting economic productivity in our largest city in this country. ",10/11/2022 14:58
792,a,Shanan Halbert,"That requires ambition. We cannot continue to repeat past mistakes of ad hoc planning and a scramble to build infrastructure when it is all too late. The challenges that we experience in playing catch-up now are driving us crazy and that is impacting on our city, yet options like congestion charging need to be seriously considered to support mode shift and to provide funding for us to do this. The question that we ask ourselves is: would you pay the price of a coffee to get to where you need to, faster? Aucklanders know what traffic is like during the school holidays, and that, in fact, is what congestion pricing can achieve for us instantly. ",10/11/2022 14:58
793,a,Shanan Halbert,"Transport is one of our largest sources of emissions and accounts for 17 percent, or one-sixth, of total greenhouse gas emissions, and, equally, it is an area where we all can make a difference immediately. As a part of this Government, I'm committed to ensuring that all people have a chance to change the way that they travel. I acknowledge that this Government is upgrading New Zealand's transport system to make it safer, to make it greener and more efficient for now and future generations to come. That is about ensuring that our generations and our communities have good options and tools available for them for the trips that they need to make around our busiest city, and our commitment to infrastructure investment will continue to play a critical role in securing our economy and recovering from the pandemic that we have experienced.",10/11/2022 14:58
794,a,Shanan Halbert,"The Transport and Infrastructure Committee is a select committee that I am very proud to be the chair of. We received 435 submissions back in March 2021 and we heard from 41 submitters in Auckland and Wellington, and we also met with colleagues offshore where they have implemented congestion pricing.",10/11/2022 14:58
795,a,Shanan Halbert,"Can I acknowledge the former chairperson and now Deputy Speaker, Greg O'Connor, who was part of our team on our select committee; Paul Eagle; Julie Anne Genter; Christopher Luxon; Dr James McDowall; the Hon Mark Mitchell; Terisa Ngobi; and Helen White. We worked constructively as a team to seriously review the opportunities that congestion pricing could play in Tāmaki-makau-rau Auckland, and worked through the terms of reference together to ensure that we could get the best outcomes for our people and for our communities.",10/11/2022 14:58
796,a,Shanan Halbert,"We made a number of recommendations in this report to this House: firstly, that we progress legislation to enable New Zealand cities to use congestion pricing as a tool in transport planning. Number two was to implement a congestion pricing scheme in Auckland, including, as described in The Congestion Question technical report, a region-wide strategic corridor scheme starting in the central city, where access is charged for and that would apply once per journey in peak times. This would use the automatic number plate recognition—ANPR—technology to identify vehicles that incur a charge. The recommendation would be to undertake broad public engagement to help people understand the cost as well as the benefits of a specific scheme, and that the House would consider whether existing schemes could be used to reduce the inequity that we faced in Auckland caused by implementing a congestion charge—and this came through very clearly from submitters and via the committee.",10/11/2022 14:58
797,a,Shanan Halbert,"We recommended that we use any revenue raised by the congestion pricing scheme to mitigate equity impacts on people and communities in Auckland and, in fact, that that money was reinvested in the public and active transport in the region, where the charge would apply. It would undertake research into whether changes to or the removal of the Auckland regional fuel tax may be appropriate if congestion pricing is implemented, and it would investigate the potential for any enabling legislation for congestion pricing to also provide for low-emission zones in our city and closely monitor the effectiveness of any congestion pricing scheme and act promptly to mitigate any unintended congestion in areas not included in the network.",10/11/2022 14:58
798,a,Shanan Halbert,"We really thank the submitters in this inquiry for the contribution that they made. They came with energy, but they also came with a robust debate. They saw the opportunity in front of them to de-congest our city—to move around more quickly—but they did come up with key themes that they wanted us to consider, and that particularly was around the inequity that some people in our city face but also some of the challenges that that presented and potential rat-run challenges in the congestion environment.",10/11/2022 14:58
799,a,Shanan Halbert,"We believe public input on this matter is important and we want to continue that, and we believe that it is important that information about the benefits of a congestion pricing scheme is shared very widely, because what the public will see first and foremost is the cost that is put in front of them and in our costs of living challenges that our country faces at the moment. We also want to present the opportunity—and I started my presentation in the House today talking about: for the price of a cup of coffee, would you pay that to get yourself or your family to somewhere faster? That is the opportunity that congestion pricing presents to Aucklanders.",10/11/2022 14:58
800,a,Shanan Halbert,"On the Government front, congestion pricing is a new initiative for New Zealand. We have spoken offshore to our counterparts, but that means that we want to build a sustained support that will be necessary to demonstrate success through regular monitoring and review points. Schemes submitted for approval would need to set out the monitoring, review, and arrangements. ",10/11/2022 14:58
801,a,Shanan Halbert,"Regarding the concerns raised by the committee, which I talked about before—the rat-running—the Government agrees that people need to feel confident that congestion will not simply move from a main road into residential areas and that they are not designed for high volumes of traffic. I think that's a very important point that came up in this inquiry, because people will try to avoid the costs that are put in front of them, but that will impact on our suburban areas. A careful scheme design is required to reduce the risk of rat-running, and monitoring of any scheme with the ability to amend it is essential. The technology solution proposed in The Congestion Question report—the ANPR cameras—is relatively flexible and low-cost in terms of installation, meaning that a scheme could be adjusted to cover the relevant streets if rat-running takes place.",10/11/2022 14:58
802,a,Shanan Halbert,"I want to acknowledge finally, in my final minute, the contribution from Te Kaunihera o Tāmaki Makaurau, or Auckland Council, and I acknowledge that we have had an election since then. But I suspect that their contribution and their commitment to congestion pricing remains the same. ",10/11/2022 14:58
803,a,Shanan Halbert,"Auckland could benefit from a sustainable 8 to 12 percent improvement in network performance in line with school holiday conditions, and I think it's an important part for Aucklanders that we see the opportunity to reduce trip times for where we're going at any time of the day and that we reduce demand for peak period and overall traffic volumes. It acts as an incentive to encourage more and more people to use our public transport system in Auckland, and ultimately helps achieve our climate goals for what is one of the biggest challenges in front of our transport sector.",10/11/2022 14:58
804,a,Shanan Halbert,"So, without further ado, I'm very pleased with the report that the Transport and Infrastructure Committee sent back to the House. I think there's a great opportunity for us to consider further in congestion pricing for Aucklanders, and as an MP in Auckland and the member for Northcote, I see the opportunities primarily for my own community. Thank you very much.",10/11/2022 14:58

809,Speech,Speaker," Members, it has come to my attention that the reply to written question No. 38016 from the Minister of Health contained an unparliamentary remark directed at Dr Shane Reti. Replies to questions must not contain discreditable references to members or offensive or unparliamentary expressions—Standing Order 396(3). This is not the first reply from the Minister to contain such a remark. As a result, I intend to award Dr Reti five additional supplementary questions to ask of the Minister of Health this week.",8/11/2022 14:01
810,a,Speaker,"If any other further such replies to written questions come to my attention, I will award a larger number of supplementary questions to the National Party to ask of any Minister. A written answer is primarily a matter between the Minister and the member. Where a member considers an answer inadequate or when overdue, I expect the member to follow up with the Minister in the first instance. However, I intend to continue my predecessor's practice where an answer contains unparliamentary language. In that case, I will intervene as soon as it comes to my attention, because it is not fair to expect a member to try and obtain a reasonable answer in such circumstances.",8/11/2022 14:01

815,Speech,Jenny Salesa," Mālō ni, Mr Speaker, and happy Tokelau Language Week. I move, That the House take note of the report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on its briefing on disarmament, which was initiated on 20 May 2021.",27/10/2022 15:00
816,a,Jenny Salesa,"We invited the Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control, the Hon Phil Twyford, to brief us on this issue, and I would like to thank the Minister and his officials from the International Security and Disarmament Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as the clerks and officers that assisted in finalising this report. ",27/10/2022 15:00
817,a,Jenny Salesa,"As members of this House will be aware, the current global security environment is becoming more fractured, increasingly fraught, and challenging to navigate. The relative sense of peace and stability that Europe and the rest of the world have enjoyed since World War II has been shattered by Russia's unprovoked, unjustified, and illegal invasion of Ukraine. Aotearoa New Zealand's approach has not been to despair at the current state of the international security environment, and, instead, the view has been a call to action. Our Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern, has made clear New Zealand's strong view that the legacy of Russia's invasion of Ukraine must not be an arms race to a more polarised and dangerous world. What is needed is an equal commitment to international institutions, to multilateral forums, and to disarmament.",27/10/2022 15:00
818,a,Jenny Salesa,"This timely briefing on disarmament covered a range of matters in which New Zealand is involved or is taking an interest. This includes multilateral agreements and treaties; progress on nuclear disarmament, including our perspective on the 2022 conference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and future steps; and emerging disarmament issues, autonomous weapons, and the militarisation of space and Antarctica. ",27/10/2022 15:00
819,a,Jenny Salesa,"New Zealand is an active participant in multilateral agreements that are aimed at reducing or controlling the use of both nuclear and conventional weapons. This is significant in terms of New Zealand's foreign policy engagement, especially in an increasingly charged security environment which includes increased superpower rivalry and the threat by Russia to use nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. ",27/10/2022 15:00
820,a,Jenny Salesa,"New Zealand is a signatory to two international treaties concerning nuclear weapons. The first is the 52-year-old Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which commits the nuclear weapon States—the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France—to disarmament and return for other countries foregoing the right to acquire nuclear weapons. Aotearoa New Zealand was one of the first signatories to the NPT, which entered into force in 1970, and we participated in the recent 10th review conference of the NPT, which was held in New York in August of this year. There was a delegation from Aotearoa New Zealand led by the Minister the Hon Phil Twyford; myself as well as the Hon Todd McClay from the National Party were also part of that delegation. ",27/10/2022 15:00
821,a,Jenny Salesa,"The second treaty is the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which came into force on 21 January 2021, and 50 countries ratified it, committing to making nuclear weapons illegal within their territories. I've got to say that New Zealand is one of the strong leaders of this particular treaty. New Zealand participated in the first meeting of the State parties to this treaty, which was held in Vienna in June of this year, and our Minister, the Hon Phil Twyford, was the person that represented Aotearoa New Zealand.",27/10/2022 15:00
822,a,Jenny Salesa,"With regard, however, to the review conference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation on Nuclear Weapons, members of our select committee asked the Minister when he came to present what had been New Zealand's aims in going to this conference in New York. The Minister said that the bottom lines were the following: a specific new commitment on disarmament from nuclear weapons States; increased accountability and transparency, including a structure for monitoring and reporting on progress between sessions; language recognising the humanitarian consequences of the use of nuclear weapons; and a specific mention within the NPT of the prohibition treaty, TPNW. Unfortunately, however, this was not achieved. The draft outcome was actually not signed—Russia did not agree to this treaty.",27/10/2022 15:00
823,a,Jenny Salesa,"Our committee expressed the view that for progress to be made on the NPT, the leaders of the five nuclear States that are party to the NPT must be prepared to meet together with the others and to directly negotiate on disarmament issues. Our Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee also asked about the size, the age, and the state of the nuclear weapons stockpile held by nuclear weapons States, and the Minister replied that, overall, the numbers of nuclear warheads have reduced from the 63,000 that used to be held at the height of the Cold War. However, there are still about 14,000 nuclear warheads held by NPT nuclear weapons States. Of these, 90 percent, roughly, are evenly split between the United States and Russia, with China holding several hundred and the United Kingdom and France holding 200 to 300 each. Experts suggest that we are closer to the use of nuclear weapons than at any other time since the height of the Cold War. Therefore, there has never been a greater need for progress on nuclear disarmament.",27/10/2022 15:00
824,a,Jenny Salesa,"I would like at this point to reflect on the effects of nuclear weapons, especially on the Pacific Islands. Nuclear weapons effects on Pacific people have been unimaginable. From radioactive contamination, there have been devastating effects on human health, environmental degradation, and social cohesion has also been affected. In 2020, the UN Special Rapporteur on toxics called the legacy on nuclear testing on the Pacific—and I quote—""one of the cruellest examples of environmental injustice [ever] witnessed"". From the years 1946 to 1996, 300 nuclear tests have been conducted—300 nuclear tests—in the Pacific. So the impact this testing has had on ecology and the environment, and especially on the physical and mental health of Pacific people, has indeed been profound. ",27/10/2022 15:00
825,a,Jenny Salesa,"When we were at the conference over in New York, there was a presentation from the Marshall Islands, and some of us actually—she was really quite emotional, describing how the people in the Marshall Islands have been affected. They've suffered radiation poisoning. Birth defects, leukaemia, thyroid, and many other cancers, to name a few, are still prevalent among their people that have been exposed to nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands. She also described that four of the islands were partially or completely vaporised and some have become the subjects of medical research and atomic refugees.",27/10/2022 15:00
826,a,Jenny Salesa,"Unfortunately, as I said earlier on, in the closing hours of that treaty review, Russia blocked the adoption of the document and so the treaty was not signed. We in New Zealand were deeply disappointed at this result, but Aotearoa New Zealand remains committed to disarmament and to global advocacy on the use of weapons. ",27/10/2022 15:00
827,a,Jenny Salesa,"We must continue to remain engaged with our commitments to international institutions, to multilateral forums, and to disarmament. As our Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern, has put it at the 2022 NATO Summit—and I quote—we must ""put a halt in the production of weapons that create our mutually assured destruction, because the alternative is unfathomable."" I commend our select committee's report on disarmament to this House. Mālō 'aupito.",27/10/2022 15:00

The release of results by the Ministry of Education is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. An urgent debate is a way of holding the Government accountable for an action—Speaker's ruling 200/4. Ms Stanford stated in her application that the Government has made no formal statements around the release of the results. While the release of the report may warrant an urgent debate, this must be exceptional, especially where working through a report's recommendations may take some time—Speaker's ruling 208/6.

846,a,Brooke Van Velden,"Every day, New Zealanders engage with our healthcare system. Thousands of people actively seek help from other New Zealanders who go to work to help make people better. We, most of the time, hope that other people can solve our problems because of the knowledge that they have and the care that they have for us. On very rare occasions, people go to the emergency departments and they need desperate help. They are really in the time of their most vulnerable point of their life, needing assistance from other people to help them get better.",18/10/2022 15:13
847,a,Brooke Van Velden,"Now, in the case of this 50-year-old woman who went to Middlemore Hospital, she was turned away from the care that she needed because the hospital was under such pressure. I'm sure there will be many New Zealanders up and down our country who are wondering: could they possibly be put into the same situation as this poor woman who lost her life because she did not receive the care that she needed when she was at her most vulnerable?",18/10/2022 15:13
848,a,Brooke Van Velden,People often go to the emergency department not even for themselves but for their children or for their husbands and wives when they know that they are desperately needing somebody else and they have no idea what's gone wrong.

Will this report into Middlemore Hospital actually change anything? Will we see wait times decrease? Will we see the number of beds in our hospitals increase?

853,a,Brooke Van Velden,"There are wonderful New Zealanders who work in our emergency departments. They are often stressed, they are often overworked, and it's because we have a healthcare crisis. We don't have enough people working in our emergency departments or across the entire healthcare sector to care for the number of people that are often looking for care.",18/10/2022 15:13
854,a,Brooke Van Velden,"We need to know from the Government what they are doing to make sure that there are adequate numbers of workers in our emergency departments, that people aren't overworked when they're needing to create diagnosis, and that in the future, we can be guaranteed that there will be enough doctors and nurses and triage staff there to make the right decisions in a good amount of time, rather than making decisions based on the fact that they are overworked, overtired, and too stressed to make a good decision.",18/10/2022 15:13
855,a,Brooke Van Velden,"We also need to know what the Government will do to increase the number of bed capacity in our country. It's not just contained to Middlemore; we have this issue across our hospitals in the whole country. When we were talking about the COVID response in particular, we had lockdowns because the health Minister and the Prime Minister and everybody involved with the Government told us we don't have enough beds to care for the number of people who are needing care during the COVID pandemic. Well, most of that is over, but we still don't have enough beds for the flu season. What is happening to make sure that in ongoing years, we are going to have enough bed capacity for the people who need our emergency departments on any given day? We can't keep blaming it on COVID; we need to have an adequate response to what the acceptable level of care that a New Zealander can expect in their healthcare system is.",18/10/2022 15:13
856,a,Brooke Van Velden,"We need to know that when a kid is really hurt and their parents are stressed and worried and they are taking them in a car or in an ambulance to hospital, they can get the care that they need, that they can get a bed in a hospital that they need and they're not going to have to wait overnight, then over days, or go back home to then come back the next day and be in a constant state of stress. We need to know that they get the care as quick as humanly possible without overworking the staff that we currently have. ",18/10/2022 15:13
857,a,Brooke Van Velden,"We rely on public confidence for our entire democratic institution. Every day, people get up and work and pay their taxes because they know that they're contributing to the Government taking our money and spending it on things that people know that they can collectively contribute to—things like the police, things like health, and making sure that we have an education system. I don't think New Zealanders would be happy to know that we are spending, wastefully, millions and millions and millions of dollars on projects that don't deliver any benefits for people. And yet at the same time, we have a healthcare system that is crippled. We have a healthcare system that can't give adequate care to people in their time of need. That's a basic role of this Government—that people put our faith in our institutions. We collectively work together to become a community, and pay our taxes so that we can help each other in our time of need, and that's not happening in this case. We have to do better.",18/10/2022 15:13
858,a,Brooke Van Velden,"I think people would also ask the question of what this means for our immigration settings. You know, we have a lot of people internationally who do work in the healthcare profession, and we know that they should and could come to New Zealand to help our overburdened healthcare workers. Why has the Government not responded adequately to allow nurses, for example, on the fast track of the Green List for residency? That is a barrier to helping to reduce the issues within our emergency departments. It's one simple point that the Government could make and one that we've been calling for in the ACT Party. ",18/10/2022 15:13
859,a,Brooke Van Velden,"We also need to know why the Government hasn't been adequately addressing the need for more productivity and more economic growth so that people can become wealthier and, over time, pay more taxes. Over time, that means we can actually increase the amount that we spend in our healthcare system without overburdening everybody else's need for funding within the Government departments. We know that we are not as wealthy as some of our OECD comparative countries, and that means that we can't spend as much on healthcare as other countries. It's a shame that we don't put enough emphasis on the need for economic growth and the benefits that this could provide to our entire economy—but importantly, how much we can spend on giving people valuable care in their time of need. ",18/10/2022 15:13
860,a,Brooke Van Velden,"We also need to train more doctors. What is this Government doing to make sure that we're not just bringing in people from overseas to help with our workforce shortage but that we can train people here in New Zealand who want to be trained? We've had a cap on the number of doctors that we train every year for quite a while. Is the Government seeking to increase this so that we can actually have more people in our emergency departments and more people who can help people in their time of need, or does the Minister of Health believe that the number of doctors that we have currently being trained in our country is adequate? Because, looking at this report saying that it's an overcrowded emergency department, hospitals are well over capacity, and it's unsafe and unsustainable, surely that means there is need for change. Or is there? I question the Minister about whether or not this Government believes it's important to train more doctors. Do we need to train more nurses? Same question. Are we training enough people in this country who genuinely want to work in the nursing profession to give people care in their time of need? That's the same issue. We are just so overburdened and over capacity within our healthcare system that there has to be a better way. ",18/10/2022 15:13
861,a,Brooke Van Velden,"I think that we need to acknowledge the tragedy that's occurred and make sure that this doesn't happen to somebody else, and that if it was a preventable death, those deaths remain preventable. It is a tragedy to the family members and the friends of this woman who lost her life because she didn't get the care that she needed when she was desperately in need of it. It's important that our healthcare system learns from this incident now, and that we don't just have a report and it goes into a filing cabinet somewhere and nobody ever reads it—nobody from the Government departments reads it, nobody from the new Te Whatu Ora reads it. It's important that this loss of life doesn't go nowhere. There are New Zealanders who will be reading and hearing about this poor woman's case and wanting to know whether or not this will happen again in the future. Will they get the care that they need, will their children get the care that they need, will their family members and friends get the care that they need, or would a preventable death not occur? Would it happen? It needs to remain preventable if at all possible.",18/10/2022 15:13
862,a,Brooke Van Velden,"I want to end by acknowledging, once again, this woman who lost her life. We're very sorry that that happened, we share our condolences with her family and friends, and we hope that our healthcare system and the Government can learn from this report. Thank you, Mr Speaker.",18/10/2022 15:13
863,Speech,Speaker," Members, I wish to advise the House that I have received a letter from the Rt Hon Trevor Mallard resigning his seat in the House with effect from midnight on Thursday, 20 October 2022.",29/09/2022 14:01
864,Speech,Marja Lubeck," I move, That the House take note of the report of the Education and Workforce Committee on the inquiry into migrant exploitation.",29/09/2022 14:47
865,a,Marja Lubeck,"The report of the Education and Workforce Committee on the inquiry into migrant exploitation was an in-depth and constructive inquiry. As chair of the select committee, I would like to begin by thanking all the submitters who took time to write to us or present to us. We had a total of 82 written submissions, 55 from individuals and 27 organisations, and we heard many of these in person.",29/09/2022 14:47
866,a,Marja Lubeck,"I will begin with the context in which this inquiry was carried out. As noted in the introduction of our report, migrant exploitation is widespread and takes many forms. It's a spectrum of non-compliance with minimum employment legislation, from ignorant non-compliance through to forced labour and people-trafficking. Migrant workers are more likely to be underpaid, denied leave, made to work excessive hours, and denied basic employment protections, resulting in financial, physical, and psychological suffering. Exploitative work practices have negative implications for our economy. Such practices undercut good employers and contribute to wage suppression and job displacement in low-paid industries. Migrant exploitation negatively affects New Zealand's international reputation, and it must be condemned.",29/09/2022 14:47
867,a,Marja Lubeck,"The number of complaints to Immigration New Zealand about exploitation have increased significantly over the last decade, from 31 allegations in 2011-12 to 390 in 2018 and 2019, and with the launch of new reporting tools in 2021, that number subsequently rose to 855. Eleven percent of temporary migrants who responded to our survey also reported that they felt threatened by their employer.",29/09/2022 14:47
868,a,Marja Lubeck,"With these very serious issues in mind, we started an inquiry into migrant exploitation on 20 October 2021. Within this inquiry, we were also interested in the reforms made as a result of the 2019 review of temporary migrant workers. We drafted our terms of reference, seeking to consider the frequency and scale of exploitation of migrant workers in New Zealand, investigate the impact of exploitation and what can be done to address that impact. Through the inquiry, we planned to look into the Government processes used to investigate cases of exploitation and find out what barriers prevent migrants coming forward to report exploitation.",29/09/2022 14:47
869,a,Marja Lubeck,"In 2019, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) led the review into the exploitation of temporary migrant workers. As part of that review, it convened a consultation group representing migrants, businesses, unions, and international students. It undertook public consultation on policy proposals. The submissions that we received for this inquiry reflect many of MBIE's findings from their 2019 review. Submitters described the causes and most common forms of migrant exploitation. Exploitative employers take advantage of the power imbalance between employers and migrant workers. This imbalance is often compounded by cultural differences, the migrant's isolation from family and friends, and their unfamiliarity with New Zealand laws. Some submitters said that employers believe that they are unlikely to be caught exploiting migrants. MBIE agrees with submitters that employers need to have a better understanding of their obligations. It also agrees that employers' compliance with employment law needs to improve and that greater powers are needed to investigate and take action against exploitative employers.",29/09/2022 14:47
870,a,Marja Lubeck,"MBIE has expanded its information and education activities since July 2021. These activities are aimed at improving employers' awareness of their obligations. The dedicated phone line for migrant exploitation has answered over a thousand calls since it launched in July 2021. The general employment phone line received over 77,000 calls in the last year. Many were from employers seeking to better understand their obligations or how to meet them.",29/09/2022 14:47
871,a,Marja Lubeck,The new Accredited Employer Work Visa will require employers to be accredited and pass a job check before they are allowed to employ migrant workers. This visa has become the main pathway for employer-assisted temporary work visas from 4 July this year. The process for the new Accredited Employer Work Visa will allow Immigration New Zealand to conduct compliance checks with employers after the initial application process has finished. This promotes further accountability for employers.,29/09/2022 14:47
872,a,Marja Lubeck,"The Government has allocated $50 million to support its implementation of new measures to address migrant exploitation. This also funds an information and education plan. The plan focuses on providing more information to employers and migrant workers about employment rights and obligations, visas, and support for victims.",29/09/2022 14:47
873,a,Marja Lubeck,"We acknowledge the work gone into education and information for employers. We believe that migrant exploitation will primarily be lessened through better enforcement and monitoring. We welcome the increase in the number of Immigration New Zealand staff and labour inspectors dedicated to investigating reports of migrant exploitation. We recommend the ongoing evaluation of the Accredited Employer Work Visa to determine whether accreditation and ongoing compliance checks are comprehensive in preventing exploitation. Along with this, we recommend the Government investigate ways for migrants to be better informed about their employment rights through the information provided in the Employment New Zealand learning modules.",29/09/2022 14:47
874,a,Marja Lubeck,"A large proportion of submitters identified employer-assisted visas as a cause of migrant exploitation. These visas involve tying a migrant's immigration status to a particular employer. Submitters said this creates a power imbalance between the employer and the migrant worker. This imbalance can be abused. MBIE said that being on an employer-assisted visa is one factor that can increase the risk of exploitation, and the aim of this visa is to prevent exploitative employers from hiring migrants. We recommend there be ongoing evaluation of whether migrant exploitation protection visas and variations of conditions are easily and quickly accessible. This evaluation must consider processing times.",29/09/2022 14:47
875,a,Marja Lubeck,"Submitters identified a number of barriers preventing migrants from reporting exploitation. These include immigration and visa status, financial uncertainty, and inadequate support for victims. Submitters proposed a range of solutions. They include better information for migrants about their rights; more financial, language, and legal support for migrants; greater empathy from officials; faster immigration processes; and amnesties for overstayers.",29/09/2022 14:47
876,a,Marja Lubeck,"MBIE said that it views reducing barriers to reporting exploitation as key, and as a result of its 2019 review launched a dedicated phone number and new online form to make it easier to report migrant exploitation. We realise it can be difficult for migrants to report exploitation, and we acknowledge the bravery of the people who came forward. We note the work that has been done to mitigate barriers to reporting exploitation. We recommend that the Government allocate more funding to organisations that support victims of migrant exploitation and investigate how it can prevent exploitation from occurring in the first place.",29/09/2022 14:47
877,a,Marja Lubeck,"Restricting work rights for partners of work visa holders may have negative outcomes. We heard repeatedly from submitters that migrants don't report exploitation because they fear deportation or other changes to their visa status. Similarly, some migrants may not report family violence because their immigration status is tied to an abusive partner. MBIE said that changes to work rights for partners of work visa holders are being made in the context of the Government's immigration rebalance. It said the rebalance aims to improve productivity and ensure the migrant workforce is high-skilled. MBIE has said that the requirements imposed on Accredited Employer Work Visa holders need to also be applied to their partners. Not doing so would undermine the Government's goal of limiting the ability of employers to hire migrants for lower-skilled, lower-paid roles. We recommend that the Government prioritise work to make sure migrant partners and families are suitably supported by the immigration system after any situations of family violence.",29/09/2022 14:47
878,a,Marja Lubeck,"As previously mentioned, the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) policy review which was begun in 2019 but delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic is currently under way, with proposals anticipated to be put before Cabinet by mid-2023. The review has a specific focus on the wellbeing of the RSE worker, including the quality of accommodation and the rules for deductions. We recommend the Government work to ensure that employers who provide accommodation to their employees do not lock workers into substandard accommodation arrangements.",29/09/2022 14:47
879,a,Marja Lubeck,"I want to again thank all those who took the time to contribute to this piece of work. Their valuable contributions have shaped an important piece of work. I also want to thank the Office of the Clerk, our officials, and my colleagues on the select committee around the House for their collaborative contributions. I'm proud of the report our committee has presented, and we hope our report highlights the important issue and the work still to be done. With our borders open once again and near-record low unemployment, migrant workers are returning to New Zealand, helping to grow our economy and bring new perspectives to our communities.",29/09/2022 14:47
880,a,Marja Lubeck,"Protecting migrant workers from exploitation is a priority for the Government, and today's introduction by the Hon Priyanca Radhakrishnan of the Worker Protection (Migrant and Other Employees) Bill will crack down on employer non-compliance.

On behalf of His Majesty's loyal Opposition—that's the first time I've said that, and it does take a bit of getting used to—I'm very pleased to support this motion; it's necessary. The machinery of Parliament and Government does rely on the clear definition of working days, because so many of the obligations for things like reporting back on reports and so on does follow that metric. And, of course, as the Leader of the House said, the written questions process takes quite a bit of administration behind the scenes; we hit the button and off they go, and we know that there's quite a bit to be done.

Today, during discussions around ministerial conflicts of interest, I observed that family members in successive Governments have been engaged within the Public Service in a wide range of roles, and conflicts of interest have been appropriately managed.

While this matter is not recent, since it refers to events last year, there have been new developments of the sort contemplated in Speaker's ruling 205/4. At the heart of Mr Seymour's application is his view that a Minister should have clarified or further explained his earlier statements on the alert level shift in Northland once more information came to light. The absence of action is not a particular case of recent occurrence for which an urgent debate can be held—see Speakers' ruling 205/5.

904,a,Nanaia Mahuta,"Mikhail Gorbachev was one of the 20th century's most notable leaders and politicians. As General Secretary and as President, Mr Gorbachev brought strategic ambition and courage to his vision for the Soviet Union. ",1/09/2022 14:00
905,a,Nanaia Mahuta,"Mr Gorbachev came to power in 1985. At 54 he was seen as a young man in the role, and he followed a succession of elderly and fragile leaders. The Soviet economy was stagnant, and in 1984 he is reported to have said to his future Foreign Minister, ""We cannot live this way any longer."" His policies of perestroika and glasnost to reform the USSR economy and society were radical in their attempts to reform the communist system. Mr Gorbachev was a man of purpose, determination, and resilience. The UN Secretary António Guterres has hailed Mr Gorbachev as having done more than any other individual to bring about the peaceful end of the Cold War.",1/09/2022 14:00
906,a,Nanaia Mahuta,"Mr Gorbachev also faced significant foreign policy challenges, perhaps none greater than the threat of nuclear weapons. In his initial months in power, Gorbachev announced a unilateral freeze on deploying intermediate range missiles in Europe. Through engagement and dialogue, and with US President Reagan as a partner, he offered a different view of the world's future, amplified by this statement ""A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought."" Gorbachev's relentless efforts on nuclear disarmament and arms control reminds us of what is possible and can be achieved, even in times of conflict and heightened tensions. Mr Gorbachev understood the counterbalance required to preserve stability.",1/09/2022 14:00

Greg O'Connor has been the member for Ōhāriu since 2017. In those five years, in addition to being a diligent electorate MP, he's been the chairperson of the Transport and Infrastructure Committee, deputy chairperson of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, a member of the Justice Committee and the Social Services and Community Committee, chairperson of the Parliamentary Service Commission's Health and Safety Committee, and co-chairperson of the New Zealand - South and South East Asia Parliamentary Friendship Group.

He has a distinguished and exceptional record of service to New Zealand as a member of the New Zealand Police, rising to the rank of senior sergeant.

He described in his maiden speech the effect of, and I quote, ""[being] armed with a new identity—a black leather jacket, a beard, long hair, and earrings"", and he was responsible for putting some of New Zealand's most serious offenders behind bars. But he also developed an understanding of why they had adopted a life outside the law in the first place. In his maiden speech, he said, and I quote, ""You can't get back on to the straight and narrow if you never knew what straight and narrow looked like in the first place.""

The responsibility for the protection and enhancement of civil liberties in New Zealand, when in Government, is shared between the Minister of Justice and the Attorney-General, and the Cabinet paper that kicked off this process was authored by both the Hon Andrew Little and myself, as Attorney-General. Now, of course, the Minister of Justice is the Hon Kiritapu Allan, and she kindly allowed me to make the first speech in this third reading and I appreciate that. ",23/08/2022 21:06

We deliberated through that select committee—it was heard at the Privileges Committee—and allowed as much time as it took to reach, essentially, an accord around the committee that we were landing this in the right place. Those select committee deliberations took place over two parliaments. It started in the last Parliament and continued in this Parliament.",23/08/2022 21:06
992,a,David Parker,"The first reading of this bill that we're considering tonight was in May 2020, and members can see from the effluxion of time that we haven't tried to push this through with haste. We've actually tried to take everyone with us. ",23/08/2022 21:06
993,a,David Parker,"This is the most significant change to the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act since the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act was passed in 1990. It's certainly not as significant as that piece of legislation, but it's probably the most significant constitutional change that I've been at least partially responsible for since I've arrived here, and I want to explain a bit of the history and why I believe this is a very important advance at this time.",23/08/2022 21:06
994,a,David Parker,"When the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 was passed, earlier iterations of it proposed that we would confer on the courts the jurisdiction to strike down primary legislation. The Parliament of the time, in 1990, thought that that was wrong and that the conduct of the executive and other lower-level decision-makers within the government apparatus should be able to have their decisions quashed by the courts in respect of decisions that infringed the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act but that primary legislation passed by this House should not be able to struck down by the courts. I think that Parliament was right back then to narrow the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act in that way, and that remains good in principle today.",23/08/2022 21:06
995,a,David Parker,"I look around the world at the moment and I see a lot of the challenges that are faced by democracies around the world trying to manage current events, and I think that the system of Government that we have in New Zealand is a very good one for us to have at the moment. I like the fact that we have a power that is pretty clearly ensconced within the elected Government of the day, who control, effectively, the votes in Parliament through the majorities that they generally put together a coalition under MMP. That gives the responsibility of the Government—the Government's got nowhere to hide if things are going wrong. They really do have the power and responsibility to change things up when they need to be, and then the people of New Zealand can get rid of us every three years. Now, I'm one of those people who think it should be every four years, but we can be cast aside every three years. A new crew can come in to fix up mistakes that we make or make things better according to their view of the world, if they've convinced the voters of New Zealand that it's time for a change.",23/08/2022 21:06
996,a,David Parker,"I also have become increasingly aware that our system is underpinned by very, very strong conventions that still hold sway in New Zealand. The conventions that we adhere to in this House through the Standing Orders, the way in which we relate to the fourth estate and the way in which they relate to us, the way we respect the independent role of the courts, the way in which we have other strong institutions like the Commerce Commission or the Law Commission—all of these ingredients feed into a very sophisticated democracy in New Zealand. The role of councils, regional councils, and district councils—we've got a very good system. ",23/08/2022 21:06
997,a,David Parker,"I think that if you compare it with other countries like the United States, they don't seem to be able to grapple with current challenges like gun control or abortion or controls on campaign financing, where their system is increasingly dominated by the private wealth interests of some very wealthy people who, effectively, spend billions of dollars at election time to distort election results. All of those issues have been worked through over the years in New Zealand by our Parliament under our system. ",23/08/2022 21:06
998,a,David Parker,"That said, the protections in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act are very, very important, and perhaps they're a bit too easy for us to ignore when Parliament gets it wrong, because there are times when Parliament passes legislation which we might think is consistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act but, actually, on closer reflection it isn't, and sometimes it deliberately is passed when it is known to be inconsistent with the protections in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act.

1001,a,David Parker,"At the moment, there is no easy route back for Parliament to reconsider issues when the courts determine that we might have gone a bit far, or they think that we have gone too far, and that's essentially what this bill is about. It's about creating what is sometimes called a halfway house under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, where, although the court hasn't got the right to overturn primary legislation, they can draw Parliament's attention to the fact that they think that we've gone too far, and through the processes that are enabled by this bill and some related changes to the Standing Orders, it enables us to run a process to give further consideration to that. ",23/08/2022 21:06
1002,a,David Parker,"At the end of that consideration, the Parliament will have a debate and the executive will have a say as well, and Parliament can, effectively, say, ""Well, we think that we're right and the courts are wrong. We're elected. We take these decisions, and if people disagree with us, they can get rid of us and get a new Government, but we think the status quo is justified."", perhaps what might more often happen is that the Parliament might say, ""Well, maybe we could modify the arrangements a little in a way that make them rights-compliant."", or on other occasions a new Parliament could say, ""With the benefit of hindsight or in the light of the advice that we've had from the senior courts, we should repeal the legislation and deal with the issue that way."" So that's what this bill does. It will change the way in which civil liberties are protected in New Zealand in what, in my opinion, is an important way.",23/08/2022 21:06
1003,a,David Parker,"This came to my attention following some of the constitutional reviews that we've had. I sat on a select committee chaired by a member whose name I forget. It was chaired some time ago in an earlier Parliament, and then there was the Constitutional Review Committee, which Michael Cullen and others served on, and this was an idea that came forward—that we look at this halfway house under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act.",23/08/2022 21:06
1004,a,David Parker,"I'm going to say something about what I think this implies in respect of how far the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act itself should reach. I know there are some people who would say that we should put social rights like a right to housing, for example, or a right to an income level, or environmental rights like climate change, etc., into a bill of rights framework. I don't believe we should, and I think we should remember that if we were to do that with this legislative framework in place and the courts were to make a declaration of non-compliance, we would be inviting them into an increasingly political space where there are value judgments to be made, including as to the allocation of resources and the tension between different issues that are perhaps better judged in this House than by the courts. So for that reason, I'm not someone that wants to extend the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act to those issues. Though there may be other legislative instruments that can protect those issues in better ways than they currently are, I would not favour them being put into the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act because it would invite the courts too far into our territory.",23/08/2022 21:06
1005,a,David Parker,"Can I thank Professor Janet McLean, who was the adviser to the select committee, and the many submitters, legal academics, and civil liberties specialists—the most eminent in the country—who came before us and provided their advice to us. ",23/08/2022 21:06
1006,a,David Parker,"I won't go through the detail of the changes that were made by select committee, which have improved the bill. Suffice it to say that the bill allied with the changes to the Standing Orders creates a process that when the courts make a declaration of inconsistency with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, the Attorney-General has to present that to the House, the Clerk of the House refers that to a select committee, and the select committee report back to the House is eventually debated, as is the response of the executive. So there is some response required from this place to what will be rare but important declarations of inconsistency by the higher courts. I commend the bill to the House.",23/08/2022 21:06

1009,Speech,Speaker," It has come to my attention that replies to 24 written questions from Dr Shane Reti to the Minister of Health are overdue, some by as much as three weeks. I accept that this is a busy portfolio with over 2,000 written questions replied to this year and there is a process of change in the administrative arrangements; however, not answering questions on time is an abuse of the written question process and does not uphold the requirements for Ministers to account to this House for the offices they hold. As a result of the long delay in providing replies to these questions, I rule that the Minister will provide substantive answers to overdue questions by midday on Thursday, 11 August. Since the Opposition have been denied an opportunity to use written questions to scrutinise the Government in a timely manner, they will receive an additional 10 supplementary oral questions to be used by the end of this week.

1020,a,Grant Robertson,"It was an absolute privilege as the Minister for Sport and Recreation to be able to attend some of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham to support our athletes and to see them perform so well. The team has made New Zealanders proud. Across the full 11 days of the games, our team has shown exceptional talent, determination, and resilience. They have also upheld our values as ambassadors of our country, exhibiting fairness, humility, and empathy. ",9/08/2022 14:00
1021,a,Grant Robertson,"It has been a truly exceptional games for New Zealand. The team has won an incredible 49 medals, including 20 gold medals, 12 silver, and 17 bronze. This is all the more remarkable against the backdrop of COVID, which has disrupted the preparations of most athletes over the last two years—and much more recently in some cases. The performances of our athletes to win medals across such a variety of sports, including mountain biking, track cycling, road cycling, swimming, athletics, squash, judo, bowls, boxing, triathlon, wrestling, weightlifting, rugby, cricket, and netball, has been nothing short of remarkable. It has also been truly inspiring and exciting to see so much young talent coming through and medalling in their sport or achieving personal bests. ",9/08/2022 14:00
1022,a,Grant Robertson,"Singling out athletes in this team is hard, but I do need to acknowledge the staggering performance of our closing ceremony flag-bearer, Aaron Gate, who won four gold medals, the most by an individual New Zealand athlete at any games. He was part of an exceptional performance by our cyclists—13 medals won in the velodrome—and mountain bikers Sam Gaze and Ben Oliver, who won gold and silver respectively, as well as Georgia Williams' bronze in the time trial and Aaron's brilliant gold in the road cycling, making it 17 medals overall for our cycling team.",9/08/2022 14:00
1023,a,Grant Robertson,"Our New Zealand swimmers also rose brilliantly to the occasion, winning nine medals, five of which were gold, swimming's highest gold medal total at a games. Lewis Clareburt was the star performer, winning two gold and one bronze. He, along with cyclist Ellesse Andrews, equalled the previous record for an individual athlete of three medals at a games.",9/08/2022 14:00
1024,a,Grant Robertson,"We watched other athletes make history, with Hamish Kerr becoming the first New Zealander to win gold in the men's high jump, and then Paul Coll becoming the first New Zealander to win gold in the men's singles squash—backing it up with gold in the mixed doubles alongside Joelle King, who became our most decorated female Commonwealth Games athlete, picking up gold in the women's doubles and mixed doubles. ",9/08/2022 14:00
1025,a,Grant Robertson,"The games also saw a huge number of New Zealand records broken and personal bests set. For me, a highlight was witnessing Sam Tanner run the second-fastest-ever 1,500 metres by a New Zealander, and a personal best by three seconds. As Sam described himself, as the ""Happiest sixth-place getter ever"", he was representative of a number of performances by younger athletes that bode well for the future. The team's value and spirit were also on full display during these games. Just one example for me was witnessing Jacko Gill going around and shaking hands and thanking every official who had worked on the shotput event before he began any celebrations for his silver medal. This was a superb example of true humility and sportsmanship.",9/08/2022 14:00
1026,a,Grant Robertson,"I want to thank and acknowledge the leadership of the New Zealand team—in particular, the chef de mission, Nigel Avery; New Zealand Olympic Committee president, Mike Stanley; chief executive Nicki Nichol; and High Performance Sport New Zealand leadership and their teams. There was a renewed focus on athlete wellbeing during these games, both before and during the event, and I believe it is a model for how a team can be looked after.",9/08/2022 14:00
1027,a,Grant Robertson,"I also want to make a special acknowledgment of Tā Derek Lardelli and his whānau, who provided cultural leadership and supported the strong sense of manaakitanga that has guided the team.",9/08/2022 14:00
1028,a,Grant Robertson,"Finally, I want to acknowledge the coaches, trainers, whānau, and friends who supported our athletes, not just at the games themselves but over their lifetimes, often making significant sacrifices to support them in their sporting endeavours. I extend my thanks and congratulations to the New Zealand Commonwealth Games team and to the Birmingham 2022 organisers for the terrific effort they did in putting the games on. The games have given us such joy and pride over the last 11 days; well done to each and every one of the New Zealand team on a truly inspiring campaign.",9/08/2022 14:00

Because of COVID-19, late last year we added a third Assistant Speaker to the workforce. Today, for various reasons, all three of our Assistant Speakers are unavailable to attend the House. Two will remain so for the rest of the week, so the House needs to fill these gaps so that it can continue to function properly, particularly given that we've got a number of committee stages that will be progressed this week where we need those presiding officers.

1037,a,Jacqui Dean,"This is a rare and exciting day for the Petitions Committee—the mighty Petitions Committee. This is our second special debate on an issue that the committee has determined to be of sufficient national interest and importance that we have recommended that a special debate be undertaken. I would like, and I do hope I'm not going too far out of the Standing Orders, to welcome and acknowledge the members of Citizens Advice Bureau New Zealand (CAB) to the House. I want to welcome them all. I want to thank them very much for providing the Petitions Committee and Parliament with such a comprehensive and well-thought-out petition. I'll just remind them that they're not allowed to lean on the—just not allowed. Yeah, you'll get told off! It is a big day for us because it allows us, on the floor of this Parliament, to debate some pretty critical issues, which go wider even than digital inclusion, the issue of digital inclusion. This issue goes much wider than, for example, being able to access Government information online. Yes, that's one part of it, but the issue of digital inclusion and those people who are not included, who feel they are falling behind, leads to a number of problems for those very people.",25/08/2022 14:29
1038,a,Jacqui Dean,"I'm now going to reference my sister, Sarah, who is a disabled lady. She's lovely. She lives in a retirement village because she's a bit vulnerable. She is the most wonderful person, who's spent so much time helping residents in her community with online matters simply because a number of older New Zealanders, whether they are in their own homes or whether they are in communities, do have trouble accessing services online. I want to thank my sister, Rah—that's her name—and all of those people in our community who do give of their time to support their friends and their neighbours so that those people can engage online, for the very simple things like contacting Inland Revenue, like contacting the Ministry of Social Development, or it might be wider than that. In fact, it can be doing a bit of online grocery shopping, and particularly now in these COVID times where older folk are rightly nervous around going to the supermarket or going to the chemist or going to do their jobs in town. The ability to order online is important to them. But what if they don't have a device? What if they don't have the connectivity? What if they don't have the confidence to go online? That is digital exclusion.",25/08/2022 14:29
1039,a,Jacqui Dean,"So, back directly to the CAB's petition, I'm going to read it out. I think it's very important to put on the record of this House just what the Citizens Advice Bureau of New Zealand are asking for: ""That the House of Representatives urge the Government to address digital exclusion so that no-one is left behind because they can't or don't wish to engage online."" Citizens Advice wish ""to implement accessibility and inclusion standards for public services that include offline channels""; and they also wish ""to ensure Citizens Advice Bureau is resourced to address the impacts of public services going online"".",25/08/2022 14:29
1040,a,Jacqui Dean,"In our deliberations in the committee and in my reflection before speaking today, one simple question occurred to me, which, of course, had been raised in this very good submission. That is: what are we trying to achieve on moving to an online basis? And are we taking everyone in New Zealand with us? I think that is the critical question here. Having an online presence is marvellous for people like me who are relatively competent online. Goodness me, I was even able to apply for a new passport! It took a while; it wasn't that easy. I reflected at the time, ""This is going to take me a long time. I know I can save and I can dip back in, I can save and I can dip back in."" That level of digital literacy isn't consistent across New Zealand. So what does everybody else do? And what does a Government agency do to meet that need. I would argue: not enough.",25/08/2022 14:29
1041,a,Jacqui Dean,"I was astounded to hear today in question time, at question No. 5, the Hon David Parker, in the context of a question around how eligible New Zealanders can ensure they receive the first cost of living payment on 1 August—that was the question to the Minister. The Minister answered, and it'll be in the Hansard, that he recommended people log on to myIR to check whether the Government's cost of living payment was in their bank account. Well, that is exactly—exactly—the problem that many New Zealanders are having, and if those New Zealanders are some of those who are eligible for the Government's cost of living payment—which is a one-off payment; very good—but they're not able to access myIR by themselves, where do they go? It is consistent across other Government departments.",25/08/2022 14:29
1042,a,Jacqui Dean,"So the challenge for the Government, and the challenge for the next National Government, which is a challenge that we are very happy to take up, and I know my colleague Melissa Lee will speak more on this point, is that it is imperative that the Government meet the need—not their need. It's very nice having myIR; it's all very well, but meet the need that exists in our community. And I do not see that happening. The reason I don't see it happening is that I have an endless of stream of folk coming into my electorate office and who I meet with throughout my electorate who are struggling to access Government services online.",25/08/2022 14:29
1043,a,Jacqui Dean,"So what do people do? Who meets this unmet need? Well, of course, it's Citizens Advice Bureau—of course it is—and Citizens Advice Bureau fully acknowledge that that is their role, and thank goodness for that. The question that the Citizens Advice Bureau are asking us to say is ""You've just shifted the problem. You've gone online, you've created a need, and you're not meeting that need."" So, by having Citizens Advice, they just pick up the pieces—and so, by the way, do MPs' offices. And, yes, that is part of our role, and we are very glad to meet that need.",25/08/2022 14:29
1044,a,Jacqui Dean,"I think that Citizens Advice Bureau have raised a very important matter that we in the House and the Government need to take note of. Simply what needs to happen is that the Government of the day needs to decide to meet the need of all New Zealanders, not just those who are digitally literate. How do they do that? Please don't form another working group. Just don't do that. What is needed are concrete steps into developing a way for the Government to once again step out and do what it should be doing, and that is to support the vulnerable, the visually impaired, the disabled, the minority groups who are struggling to access digital services. It's all very well intentioned, and we must keep going with moving on to a digital platform, but the Government needs to support the people in New Zealand. Thank you, Mr Speaker.",25/08/2022 14:29
1045,Speech,Assistant Speaker, The question is that the motion be agreed to.,25/08/2022 14:29

1047,Interjection,Assistant Speaker, Leave is requested for that purpose. Any objection? There is none. ,28/07/2022 15:19
1048,ContinueSpeech,David Parker," Thank you, Mr Speaker. In answer to a supplementary on question No. 4, I made reference to a former Governor of the Reserve Bank reaching an arrangement in respect of a party list. In a slip of the tongue I said the Labour Party being the party. That was incorrect. It was the National Party.",28/07/2022 15:19
1049,Speech,Jan Logie," Thank you, Mr Speaker. It's a real pleasure to rise and speak, as briefly as it is, on behalf of the Green Party in this special debate. I too want to thank the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) for prompting this debate with a petition, but, before that, the research and analysis that led to the petition, which showed three months of client engagements that had 4,379 interactions involving digital exclusion—giving us quantitative data, I think, for the first time around the breadth of this problem in our communities and the work that's been picked up by our community organisations because of that. Such an important conversation for our Parliament.",28/07/2022 15:19
1050,a,Jan Logie,"Today I'm going to focus not on the digital aspect but the public service aspect, the social inclusion aspect, because I think that is crucially important. I want to note that while I really thank CAB for bringing this, they're not the first organisation to have been raising concerns about disconnection from Government and people. I speak most recently having participated in an amazing meeting in Porirua led by Ngāti Toa Rangatira chief executive Helmut Modlik, bringing 100 community leaders together to discuss how as a community we might help shape our services to meet the needs of people. He was saying in that meeting about how he'd been at a workshop in the Ministry of Health in 2020 to figure out how to boost vaccination rates, and when they were thinking about that, they were thinking, ""Well, what Government initiative in the past has reached everybody in the population?"" and could not come up with one single initiative that had reached everyone. ",28/07/2022 15:19
1051,a,Jan Logie,"We have a one-size-fits-all approach, and the digital approach across Government has been another example of that. It systematically fails significant groups of people. The CAB research has shown us that it's failing people who lack access to computers and internet, or who don't have digital literacy. They're possibly the obvious groups we'd think might struggle in a digital approach, as well as those with low incomes, who can't afford fancy computers that go fast or can't afford the internet access; but also people with literacy challenges, and people where English is not their first language, and people with disabilities that make reading or processing the information and being able to communicate their own needs in a written way difficult, and those who have no desire to be online—and viva those people. ",28/07/2022 15:19
1052,a,Jan Logie,"As an introvert, I am super keen on the online approach, as deeply frustrating as I find it, but I want to acknowledge too that there's been nothing in the communications from CAB or anybody else that's saying we want to get rid of that. It's just saying it needs to improve, to be more accessible, but also we have to have options that work, that are tailored for our diversity as people. The starting point for Public Service—recognising that the Government has legal obligations in its provision of public services to ensure that it does not exclude people—is to find out, actually, how do people engage? How do people want to engage? And how can the Government meet them where they are at rather than the starting point of what is easy for the organisation, the bureaucracy. Too often that has been our starting point.",28/07/2022 15:19
1053,a,Jan Logie,"I want to, too, just clearly put on record that this is not having a go at our public servants. I note that the Public Service Association has a charter that clearly says they want public services to be easy to use, to be there when people need them, and for communities to have a say in the shape of those services. People have been calling for this. Māori have been calling for this. This piece of research and this petition gives us some quantitative data to really challenge us. I'm so grateful for this Parliament to have the opportunity today to be able to have this discussion, because it's absolutely core to whether anything we discuss in this House has any chance of success, because if it's not for our people, what is it for? So thank you, CAB.",28/07/2022 15:19
1054,Speech,Chairperson," Before we go on, I just need to correct the vote on the last bill, the Data and Statistics Bill.

The correct vote is Ayes 12 and Noes 107.",28/07/2022 12:53
1055,Speech,Nanaia Mahuta," I wish to make a ministerial statement on the execution of activists in Myanmar. On Monday, 25 July Myanmar's State-run newspaper announced the execution of four people, including political figures Phyo Zeya Thaw, Kyaw Min Yu, Hla Myo Aung, and Aung Thura Zaw. The four were tried by a military court and reportedly denied access to legal counsel. This is a horrifying act by Myanmar's military regime. These executions are the first in Myanmar in decades and speak further to the regime's brutality since the coup. Our sympathies and thoughts are with the families and the loved ones of the victims at this time, and with the families and loved ones of all of those who have been killed by the military regime. ",27/07/2022 14:00
1056,a,Nanaia Mahuta,"In response, I issued a statement on 26 July which notes Aotearoa New Zealand's strong and longstanding opposition to the death penalty and condemns the executions in the strongest possible terms. New Zealand has also joined a statement at Foreign Minister level with other like-minded countries condemning the executions. Prior to the executions, New Zealand made direct representations to the Myanmar embassy in Canberra. We also shared our concerns via a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and also at the UN Human Rights Council. ",27/07/2022 14:00
1057,a,Nanaia Mahuta,"In the aftermath of the military coup in February 2021, New Zealand acted quickly and decisively to express our condemnation and to take measures to place pressure on the regime towards a return to civilian government. Immediate actions included suspending high-level political and military bilateral engagement; travel bans on those responsible for the coup and/or ongoing human rights abuses; and ensuring our Government-funded cooperation activities are not channelled through or benefit the military. Since this time, we have consistently called on the military regime to immediately end the violence, adhere to ASEAN's Five-Point Consensus and release all political prisoners including foreign nationals. We have made numerous public statements including in regional and multilateral fora, such as ASEAN ministerial meetings and UN bodies, which have made clear New Zealand's position and condemnation of the coup. ",27/07/2022 14:00
1058,a,Nanaia Mahuta,"On 1 February this year, New Zealand announced further travel bans on those with direct responsibility for the coup and/or ongoing human rights violations in Myanmar. New Zealand has also taken a position that the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will not enter into force between New Zealand and Myanmar until such time as New Zealand considers a valid instrument has been deposited by Myanmar, and the requisite timeframe under the agreement has elapsed. ",27/07/2022 14:00
1059,a,Nanaia Mahuta,"Throughout this difficult time we have continued to support the people of Myanmar, who face growing humanitarian needs as the coup's impact damages the economy and forces high levels of displacement. New Zealand has stepped up its humanitarian and resilience-building assistance since the coup to support the people of Myanmar. We have provided over $17 million to support Myanmar's internally displaced people; agricultural livelihoods and food security assistance; COVID-19 control and mitigation; protection and advocacy for international humanitarian law; and increasing the resilience of at-risk populations. ",27/07/2022 14:00
1060,a,Nanaia Mahuta,"New Zealand has been in close contact with our international partners and New Zealand community groups to understand their views on the situation in Myanmar and how we can work together to place pressure on the military regime. This includes regular contact with the Association of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) member States. New Zealand is strongly supportive of ASEAN efforts and leadership on the situation in Myanmar. In April 2021, ASEAN leaders agreed a Five-Point Consensus on Myanmar—ending violence, inclusive dialogue, appointment of a special envoy, visit of the special envoy, and humanitarian assistance—and New Zealand has been engaging with ASEAN to support this process. The ASEAN chair has made clear ASEAN's condemnation of the executions and the damage that this has on regional efforts to resolve the situation in Myanmar. ",27/07/2022 14:00
1061,a,Nanaia Mahuta,"I will be engaging with my ASEAN counterparts, and other like-minded partners, on what more can be done to support ASEAN's Five-Point Consensus to help end the violence and return Myanmar to civilian rule. The first opportunity to do this will be at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' meetings in Phnom Penh, Cambodia on 4 to 5 August, which I will attend in person. ASEAN has a practice of not inviting political level participation from Myanmar in the current circumstances, and we anticipate that this will be the case for these meetings. I will be using statements during these meetings to once again reiterate New Zealand's condemnation of the coup and these executions.",27/07/2022 14:00

1073,a,Chris Hipkins,"This is probably—well, this absolutely is—my last formal act as Minister for COVID-19 Response, a job that I've already given over, in fact, to my colleague the Hon Dr Verrall. But it is a job that I have had the great privilege of holding, at least since the election, and then for a brief period as Minister of Health before that. I have been the Minister responsible for this Act almost since it was passed by the Parliament in 2020, as we came to grips as a country with what the global pandemic would mean for us. Let's cast our minds back to 2020, when this law was first put in place. We still didn't quite know what we were dealing with at that point. The world was still grappling with COVID-19. The science was evolving and changing. New Zealand was at a point where we had managed to, by and large, eliminate COVID-19 from our community, and we were certainly, for the foreseeable future, endeavouring to keep it that way. The COVID-19 Public Health Response Act provided the Government with the relevant tools to be able to continue to pursue elimination, as we did for at least the 18 months following that. So I have to say I have some mixed emotions when it comes to continuing this legislation, which will be now administered by my successor in the role, Dr Ayesha Verrall.",28/06/2022 17:05
1074,a,Chris Hipkins,"I do want to reflect a little bit on what's happened over that last 2½-year period that we've been grappling with the global pandemic. If we want to talk about results, there is one result that stands out above all others, and that is that New Zealand has, within the OECD, depending on which day of the week you look at it—we're sitting right alongside Japan—the lowest rate of death related to COVID-19 in the OECD. If we want to talk about results, that is a result that all New Zealanders can be incredibly proud of. There are many stories that will be told of our COVID-19 response in the years to come, and those stories will typically be of people who have been in some way disadvantaged by the response, whether it was the impact that it had on their business or their livelihood, and we absolutely acknowledge that our response to COVID-19 has required a great deal of sacrifice by many people. We will also hear the stories of people who found that their plans to enter or leave New Zealand were disrupted by the border restrictions that we had in place. And, again, I don't think anybody on this side of the House would discount the significant impact that our border restrictions have had on people.",28/06/2022 17:05
1075,a,Chris Hipkins,"But there are stories that we won't hear, because we simply don't know who these people would be. We won't hear the stories of people who would not otherwise be alive today were it not for the success of our collective efforts as the team of 5 million—a phrase we don't use very much these days—in keeping COVID-19 out of our community for such a long period of time. We have, in addition to having one of the lowest rates of COVID-19 - related death in the OECD, if not the lowest, one of the highest vaccination rates in the OECD. In fact, we were more vaccinated as a country than almost any other country when we peaked in terms of the number of cases that we were seeing. I think the lower rate of hospitalisation and mortality that we've experienced in New Zealand overall, compared to other countries, really does reflect the fact that we got the vaccination campaign right, and we got the timing right when it came to a transition to a different phase of the response.",28/06/2022 17:05
1076,a,Chris Hipkins,"I must confess, on election night in 2020, while my colleagues up and down the country were celebrating enormously, I wasn't quite in such a celebratory mood. While I was enjoying the victory, I was nervous for two reasons. One is that, at about 6.50 p.m., Ashley Bloomfield had rung me and ruined my evening by telling me that there was a COVID-19 case that had been detected in the community. The other—and actually more fundamental—thing was that New Zealanders, I think, and clearly evidenced by the election night result, were very invested in an elimination strategy that was never going to be a strategy for ever. How we got from an elimination strategy to where we are now was always going to be a bit of a bumpy road. I have to confess, on election night in 2020 I could not see how we were going to get from point A to point B without there being quite a significant number of bumps in the road, and that has certainly proven to be the case.",28/06/2022 17:05
1077,a,Chris Hipkins,"But I want to reflect a little bit on the period of time that I've been Minister for COVID-19 Response with a few numbers, which I think are useful: 1,058 ministerial briefings have been signed by me during that period of time—many of them on the same day, and many of them signed on the same day in which the decision was made. I've responded to 232 Official Information Act requests, taken 136 papers to Cabinet, answered 41 oral questions in the House—and that's only the Opposition oral questions, not the ones that were posed by Government members. But it is also worth noting that I have responded to 5,038 written parliamentary questions as the Minister for COVID-19 Response, signed 49 different orders made under this Act, 22 exemptions or amendments to exemptions, and done countless media briefings, most of which were in the Beehive theatrette, only two of which I remain embarrassed by. I did learn a few lessons along the way, one of which is, if you're going to use metaphors, you should make sure you don't mix them! Because it turns out that stretching your legs and spreading your wings are two entirely different things, and if you accidentally mix those two things together, the entire country will have a good laugh at your expense! But, contrary to popular opinion at the time, there is no evidence that there has been a spike in the birth rate as a result of that press conference.",28/06/2022 17:05
1078,a,Chris Hipkins,"I want to take a moment to thank everybody who was involved in New Zealand's COVID-19 response over the last 2½ years, including those unsung heroes who went to work every day during some of the most difficult periods of the response—our essential workers, who kept the supply chains open, kept us all feed, keep the power on, keep the country moving at a time when we were all staying at home. I want to particularly thank our health workers, who continue to experience the pressure of the global pandemic now, even more so now perhaps than they were over the last two years, and acknowledge their commitment and dedication and thank them for their work. I want to thank our managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) workers, who went to work and put themselves between the virus and New Zealanders. It is worth noting that, of the nearly 230,000 returnees who returned, we stopped more than 4,600 cases at the border before they made their way into the community. We also supported, through our MIQ, 5,000 cases in the community so that they had somewhere safe to recuperate and recover from COVID-19. I really want to thank those MIQ workers for their commitment and their dedication. It was not an easy task.",28/06/2022 17:05
1079,a,Chris Hipkins,"So, turning our minds now to the purpose of this motion that extends the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act for a further period through to the end of the year. I started, as Minister, a programme of work that I know Dr Verrall will be continuing, to look at the provisions of the Act that are still in use now, that relate to measures that may well be ongoing as part of our ongoing response to COVID-19. That's one strand of work. The other strand of work is to look at our future preparedness for both new variants of COVID-19 but also future pandemics. It's likely that legislation will emerge from both of those pieces of work, and Dr Verrall, I know, will shepherd those through the House in due course. ",28/06/2022 17:05
1080,a,Chris Hipkins,"This legislation is still required at this point, although many of the restrictions that were put in place under it have already been removed. The pandemic isn't yet over. Our health system will tell you that. Experience around the world will tell you that. I've had my first opportunity to travel internationally since the pandemic began, over the last month, and I can say that the world hasn't completely gone back to normal. Other countries still do have restrictions in place. Other countries are still grappling with having large proportions of their workforce disrupted by COVID-19. New Zealand is not alone in that. We have actually weathered the global pandemic better than most of the countries that we would compare ourselves to, and we continue to do so, but the pandemic is still having an impact, and we still do need to respond to that.",28/06/2022 17:05
1081,a,Chris Hipkins,"Finally, I want to thank New Zealanders for the feedback that they have provided me over the last 2½ years in this role. Most of it was positive, quite a lot of it was humorous at various points, and some of it constructive, and some of it perhaps less so. But I want to acknowledge that the results that we've achieved as a country were only possible because New Zealanders bought into what we were trying to achieve as a collective team, and I hope that we can continue with that—that spirit of solidarity with one another and consideration of one another—as we approach whatever future challenges COVID-19 might throw at us. Thank you.",28/06/2022 17:05

1084,a,Dr Ayesha Verrall,"It's a pleasure to speak in this House as the new Minister for COVID-19 Response and, in particular, to follow that contribution from the previous Minister. I also want to take the time to thank him for the work he did over the course of his time in his roles, first, as Minister of Health and then as Minister for COVID-19 Response, to keep our country safe, to balance a strong health response with the rights of people in our population, as well as the need for us to maintain social and economic activity. The success of New Zealand's COVID-19 response has been, in large part, due to his tireless effort.",28/06/2022 17:20
1085,a,Dr Ayesha Verrall,"As the House is now well accustomed to, Parliament is required to approve orders I or the former Minister have signed, within 90 days of them being signed. Today's motion covers two different orders. ",28/06/2022 17:20
1086,a,Dr Ayesha Verrall,"First, the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Amendment Order (No 8) 2022 amends the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Order 2021. This order amends the face-covering requirements in relation to voting and ensures that a person cannot be denied entry into a voting place on vaccination grounds. It also clarifies several technical matters, including excluding all sports from the definition of a ""close-proximity business"", and clarifies the meaning of ""gathering"" to people who are a group in a defined space. I thank the Regulations Review Committee for its consideration of this order, and I note they raised no concerns.",28/06/2022 17:20
1087,a,Dr Ayesha Verrall,"The second order we are confirming today is the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Amendment Order (No 9) 2022. This order amends the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Order 2021. It clarifies that the 2-metre distancing rule applies between entertainers and their audience and creates an exemption process for a person with a physical or mental illness, condition, or disability to apply for an exemption pass, to be issued by the director-general, making them exempt from the face-covering requirements under the principal order.",28/06/2022 17:20
1088,a,Dr Ayesha Verrall,"I understand that the Regulations Review Committee wrote to the former Minister, who clarified some of the questions they raised, and I can briefly cover those responses. I am informed, in relation to the proposed enforcement of certain clauses, the former Minister confirmed that breaches of the clauses are intended to be enforced under section 26 of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 and are not the subject of infringement notice offences. This is consistent with the approach taken to the enforcement of the rules against the misuse of COVID-19 vaccine certificates. I further understand it was reinforced that enforcement action is likely to be exercised only when exemption cards are misused in organised, systemic, or serious cases. ",28/06/2022 17:20
1089,a,Dr Ayesha Verrall,"The committee also considered it was unclear whether a breach of clause 106A(7) results in liability under the Act, the Crimes Act, or both. I am informed the former Minister explained that a declaration required by an appellant for a face mask exemption and referred to in clause 106A(4)(a) is not a declaration in the form provided for in section 9 of the Oaths and Declarations Act 1957. Therefore, section 111 of the Crimes Act is not available to enforce false declarations.",28/06/2022 17:20
1090,a,Dr Ayesha Verrall,"I don't want to take up too much of the House's time today. As the new Minister, I am very much aware there is much more work to do in this portfolio to ensure our ongoing response, as well as being prepared for whatever the future may bring. Our response will continue to be based on public health advice and will continue to adapt to any new challenges or changes that we may face. I look forward to working with you all and continuing the legacy of New Zealand's successful response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",28/06/2022 17:20

1107,a,Jacinda Ardern,"On 26 June 1952, Prime Minister Sidney Holland informed the House of his attendance at events in London following the death of King George VI. On 6 February 1952, he said the following, ""The Leader of the Opposition and I were privileged to attend the funeral of King Georg VI. Before that we had been present at the Accession Council in the Throne Room at St James's Palace where the Rt Hon Mr Nash and I were placed at the end of the front row of Ministers and other Privy Councillors privileged to be present. I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition shared the deep feelings in my heart as our new and beloved Queen took her Oath of Accession, and as she signed her name for the first time: Elizabeth. And then she hesitated and she added for the first time, the letter 'R'. It crossed my mind that I was witnessing, in this company, history being written at that time, and I wondered how often that young hand will sign the same name in the days that lie ahead. I wondered at this historic occasion ushering in the new Elizabethan era. Let us all hope and pray that will come about.""",7/06/2022 14:07
1108,a,Jacinda Ardern,"On Friday, 3 June, we gathered in Wellington at the Cathedral of St Paul in a service of celebration to mark the Queen's platinum jubilee. I reflected at that time on the words of Prime Minister Sidney Holland and the fact that they proved to be prophetic. But even he may not have dared assume that he would experience the same sense of comfort and stability through challenge, through tragedy, and through change that has been provided by Her Majesty. This is the first time a British monarch has reached the milestone of 70 years, a platinum jubilee, and we acknowledge and celebrate her service with a sense of awe, reverence, and gratitude.",7/06/2022 14:07
1109,a,Jacinda Ardern,"The Queen has encouraged anyone who wants to mark the jubilee to do so by planting trees. On 6 February this year, the 70th anniversary of the Queen's accession to the Throne, I announced that the Government on behalf of New Zealanders would make a donation of $1 million to Trees That Count, to assist with tree-planting programmes across the country to mark the jubilee. A popular short walk on Rakiura / Stewart Island will also be formally renamed in honour of Her Majesty's long reign.

1115,a,Dr Ayesha Verrall,"This is another in the series of motions that ask the House to approve COVID-19 orders to ensure that they are not revoked within certain time frames. Today's motion approves three orders that came into course at various states between 16 April and 15 May. As Minister Hipkins has noted, when moving similar motions in the past couple of months or so, there are a couple of trends in their content.",7/06/2022 15:11
1116,a,Dr Ayesha Verrall,"First, the number of orders to be approved is diminishing as COVID-19 and our response to it evolves. This is to be welcomed as it signals a move away from the use of the extraordinary powers conferred upon the Minister by the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. The second positive trend is that the Regulations Review Committee has once again expressed no concerns about any of the orders covered by this motion. This should not be taken as an indication that the committee has relaxed its vigilance. It has, again, produced comprehensive reports on all three orders and I thank the committee members and their chair, Mr Chris Penk, for their work. It is, instead, a result of the maintenance of the high standards that the scrutiny of the Regulations Review Committee has done so much to create. Thanks are also due to officials at the Ministry of Health and other contributing agencies, and the Parliamentary Counsel Office—which has coped so admirably with the pressured workload that COVID-19 has brought in.",7/06/2022 15:11
1117,a,Dr Ayesha Verrall,The first order that the House is being asked to approve amends the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Order 2021 to extend medical grade face mask covering requirements to vaccine mandated workers under the orange setting. It also allowed tertiary education providers to deny secondary school students entry to their premises if those students are not vaccinated and would carry out vaccine-mandated work as part of their programme.,7/06/2022 15:11
1118,a,Dr Ayesha Verrall,The second order represents an important step in the COVID-19 response as it removed the previous isolation and quarantine requirements and replaced them with the self-isolation regime.

1120,a,Dr Ayesha Verrall,"It is our intention not to bring too many more of these approved motions to the House. But we should recognise that the system put in place by the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act has underpinned our response to COVID-19, allowing the Government to respond quickly as COVID-19 has evolved, supporting New Zealand to emerge with a strong economy and record low levels of unemployment.",7/06/2022 15:11
1121,Speech,Deputy Speaker, The question is that motion be agreed to.,7/06/2022 15:15
1122,Speech,Marja Lubeck," I move, That the House take note of the report of the Education and Workforce Committee on the inquiry into school attendance.",2/06/2022 14:49
1123,a,Marja Lubeck,"Talofa, Mr Speaker. I'm pleased to kick off the debate on the report of the Education and Workforce Committee on the inquiry into school attendance. This was a robust and constructive inquiry, and as chair of the select committee, I'd like to begin by thanking all the submitters who took time to write or present to us, officials of the Office of the Clerk and Ministry of Education, and my colleagues on the select committee for their contributions in the sphere of this inquiry was handled in.",2/06/2022 14:49
1124,a,Marja Lubeck,"I will start with how and why this inquiry started. As we noted in the introduction of our report, regular school attendance is the foundation of student achievement, and it will be no surprise that research undertaken by the Ministry of Education has found a direct relationship between attendance and achievement. However, there has been an increase in chronically absent students since 2015, and it has doubled to 9 percent between 2016 and 2022. Longstanding challenges with regard to attendance rates have been further impacted by the two years of battling with a global pandemic, COVID-19. Forty percent of students with reduced attendance did not have concerning attendance patterns at the beginning of 2020, prior to COVID-19. ",2/06/2022 14:49
1125,a,Marja Lubeck,"As I mentioned in my annual review debate contribution for the education portfolio last year, the Minister has noted his concern with school-attendance rates with the select committee in the past, particularly during the 2020 lockdown. During the annual review process, the Minister took the committee through the Government's priority to set up a means of measuring and managing the speed at which attendance rates improved post lockdown. And I would like to thank the Minister for engaging with the committee, discussing what could be done to improve the attendance of schools and kura. Off the back of this, we initiated an inquiry into school attendance on 7 July 2021. We drafted terms of reference, seeking to understand the long-term trends and factors that have impacted school attendance, and that is why we looked at the 20-year period. ",2/06/2022 14:49
1126,a,Marja Lubeck,"Within this, however, we were also interested in the changes made in 2013 to the ministry-funded Attendance Service and the impacts this has had on attendance and engagement outcomes. We wanted to hear directly from schools and other stakeholders to ensure we understood this as best as we could. Through this inquiry, we planned to identify examples of effective practice within schools and kura and other parties, where relevant, that have led to strong trends in attendance and engagement in schooling. This would allow us to identify potential strategies that could be implemented to increase attendance and inform the Government's attendance strategy. ",2/06/2022 14:49
1127,a,Marja Lubeck,"When submissions closed on 30 September 2021, we had received 133 submissions representing a range of perspectives and interests. They included students, parents, teachers, families of disabled or neurodiverse children, iwi, Attendance Service providers, and non-governmental organisations. We also had 55 oral submissions—six of which were specifically invited due to their success or experience in high levels of school attendance. In addition, we also conducted a survey, using the New Zealand Parliament Instagram account. The report on the review of the Standing Orders in 2020 recommended select committees use alternative forms of public engagement to make sure that we reach a wider range of New Zealanders. This being an inquiry into school attendance, it was very important that we heard from our rangatahi. So, through the survey on Instagram, we reached those students who otherwise may not have been able to make a submission. We received 49 responses to that particular survey, and I want to thank the Parliamentary Engagement team for their close work with us on this particular piece of work.",2/06/2022 14:49
1128,a,Marja Lubeck,"The ministry presented their final departmental report to us on 15 December 2021. I want to thank the ministry for their support and advice because they provided that important context that the submitters' experiences were occurring within, and also, the work that was already under way. From the figures we were presented with, it was clear that attendance rates held largely steady from 2011 to 2015 before they started to decline. The decline can be seen across all ethnicities. However, it's greater for Māori and Pacific students and is most heavily felt in our lower-decile schools. We said in our report that while societal causes for non-attendance cannot be solved by the education sector alone, it's worth discussing what the sector can do and what they are already doing. So our report recommended the continuation of the Ka Ora, Ka Ako/Healthy School Lunches Programme—something that Ngāpuhi iwi social services mentioned was a contributing factor to seeing returns to school. Boyd Swinburn, professor at the University of Auckland, was in full support of the programme, calling it the biggest child-nutrition intervention, by far, in decades. ",2/06/2022 14:49
1129,a,Marja Lubeck,"In regard to the in-school causes of declining attendance, we heard submitters that pointed to the importance of providing safe and inclusive learning environments. Nearly one quarter of the submissions commented that schools are not inclusive nor welcoming environments. We heard about how students can feel unsafe, alienated, and as if they don't belong—stemming from racism, bigotry, bullying, academic streaming, and cultural competence. ",2/06/2022 14:49
1130,a,Marja Lubeck,"I want to make a special mention of the following year 13 students: Sean Brownlow, student at Takapuna Grammar School; Silas Zhang, head student at Riccarton High School; Ashleigh Putt-Fallows, Southland Girls' High School, Invercargill; and fa'afetai to Iszak Tuala, year 13 student in Christchurch. It was great that we have these student voices amongst the 55 oral submissions that our select committee heard. They spoke to us about the importance of manaakitanga and of taking the holistic approach to issues of school attendance, and the need for complex and nuanced approaches to address these—with ākonga at the centre of that solution. These young submitters clearly understood that the underlying causes of non-attendance are complex and that there's not an easy fix. ",2/06/2022 14:49
1131,a,Marja Lubeck,"To quote our report, ""Every part of the education system has a role to play in ensuring students feel safe and included at school. We acknowledge that schools have different approaches to achieving this, but we also recommend that the Government continue to engage with schools on the importance of the national education and learning priorities, that they support the Te Mahau to continue to facilitate local solutions to non-attendance, and that the Ministry of Education develops a communications plan about the importance of regular school attendance targeted at families and communities."" To address regular-attendance decline amongst Māori students, we supported uniquely Māori solutions for Māori students, including the further support and funding of Māori-medium schools, mixed-medium schools, iwi organisations, and Māori Attendance Service providers. Submitters told us of the importance of tino rangatiratanga and Māori-Crown partnerships and that the factors identified to impact attendance have led to Māori disproportionately suffering.",2/06/2022 14:49
1132,a,Marja Lubeck,"We had many other recommendations to make, from early intervention policies led by Te Mahau to prevent students from becoming chronically absent to the idea that any redesign of the Attendance Service should aim to improve its relationship with those providing early intervention. We heard from submitters holding a range of views on the Attendance Service, and we heard from some that the changes made in 2013 for efficiency reasons took the service out of local community hands—with one submitter describing this process as a restructuring being an outsider solution to a complex inside-the-community problem. ",2/06/2022 14:49
1133,a,Marja Lubeck,"On the topics of what accountability measures and sanctions are used in other countries, the evidence provided through the committee concluded that punitive measures are proven to be ineffective in improving students' attendance problems. Punitive measures do not address the underlying drivers of poor performance, especially for those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. We recognise that where some students would attend school regularly, there are barriers due to disability and neurodiversity. We recommended that the ministry, in conjunction with the new Ministry of Disabled People, establish a mechanism for monitoring the number of students who do not regularly attend school full time because of their learning-support needs. We also recommended to make increasing school attendance a focus of the highest-needs review. In total, then, our report makes 22 recommendations, and the Government response is due on 9 June. Our Education and Workforce Committee members are looking forward to it, and so am I.",2/06/2022 14:49
1134,a,Marja Lubeck,"I want to, again, thank everyone who took the time to contribute. All those who we heard from have made a really important contribution and helped shape the important piece of work. I'm proud of the finished report our committee has presented, and I think it will provide a strong foundation for long-term planning to address our declining attendance rate.

1143,a,Grant Robertson,"It is my great pleasure to present New Zealand's fourth Wellbeing Budget. In each of this Government's three previous Wellbeing Budgets, we have not only considered the performance of our economy and finances but also the wellbeing of our people, the health of our environment, and the strength of our communities.",19/05/2022 14:05
1144,a,Grant Robertson,"In Budget 2020 and 2021, we applied that wellbeing approach to dealing with COVID-19. This meant taking a health- and science-led approach, focusing on caring for our people and our communities. It has meant that New Zealand has reached this stage of the pandemic in as good a position as any other country. That is not just because we still have one of the lowest death rates from COVID but also because our economy is in a stronger position than most. This has been recognised by two triple A credit ratings from leading ratings agencies, and by the likes of the OECD and IMF. It has been a tough couple of years for New Zealanders. I want to again thank businesses, workers, and all members of the community for your hard work. It means we are now in a strong position to meet the next set of challenges and take the new opportunities to provide all New Zealanders with economic security in good times and bad.",19/05/2022 14:05
1145,a,Grant Robertson,"The investments we are making in this Budget build on the progress made in Budget 2021 towards the Government's three goals for this term. These are: continuing to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19; accelerating the recovery and the rebuild from the impacts of COVID-19; and laying the foundations for the future, including addressing key issues such as climate change, housing affordability, and child poverty.",19/05/2022 14:05
1146,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2022 invests $5.9 billion a year in net new operating spending while introducing multi-year funding packages that also draw from Budget 2023 and Budget 2024 operating allowances. We are investing $2.9 billion from the Climate Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to meet our emissions reduction plan and lay the foundations for a long-term transition to a low-emissions, high-wage economy. We are also supporting New Zealanders to meet the rising cost of living caused by global inflation pressures, through a targeted package of support focusing on low and middle income New Zealanders, including a short-term cost of living payment for around 2.1 million people.",19/05/2022 14:05
1147,a,Grant Robertson,"New Zealand's overall wellbeing has held up well during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our mortality rate remains lower than those of our international peers, and life satisfaction remains high across all ethnicities. While the economic contraction associated with COVID-19 was much deeper and much more sudden than what New Zealand experienced during the global financial crisis, the economy has proven to be resilient, with economic activity in the December 2021 quarter 3.5 percent ahead of pre-pandemic levels.",19/05/2022 14:05
1148,a,Grant Robertson,"Unemployment at 3.2 percent is at record lows, household incomes have continued to rise, and balance sheets are strong across almost every sector. We have done this with some of the lowest debt in the world. Our net debt is forecast to be around one-half of Australia's, a quarter of the UK's, and a fifth of the USA's, using a comparable measure. As I have indicated, we are moving to a new debt indicator that is more in line with how other countries measure their net debt, and more accurately reflects the Government's fiscal position. On that indicator, net debt will now peak at 19.9 percent of GDP—or 41 percent using the old indicator—before reducing further over the forecast period.",19/05/2022 14:05
1149,a,Grant Robertson,"Economic growth is forecast to peak at 4.2 percent and average 2.1 percent across the forecast period. We are forecast to reach an operating balance before gains and losses—the OBEGAL—surplus in the 2024-25 financial year. This will be five years after COVID hit us and is a year earlier than the previous Government returned to surplus after the global financial crisis. New fiscal rules will oblige the Government to run a small surplus on average, over time, once we have returned to surplus, and maintain net debt at a ceiling below 30 percent of GDP. ",19/05/2022 14:05
1150,a,Grant Robertson,"This approach means that current expenses will be met from current revenue. We will have a prudent level of debt that allows for a buffer against future shocks while providing room for high-quality and much-needed investment to close our infrastructure deficit. This balanced approach to fiscal policy is critical as we face the immediate challenges that are in front us and as we address the long-term issues in our economy. The impacts of COVID-19 remain with us. Experiences of the pandemic differ greatly among New Zealanders, and its long-term effects have yet to be seen. Long-standing challenges around climate change, child poverty, productivity, and housing quality and affordability have not lost their urgency.",19/05/2022 14:05
1151,a,Grant Robertson,"On top of that, Budget 2022 is being delivered in a difficult time for the global economy and for many New Zealanders. The impacts of rising inflation due to COVID, supply chain challenges, and pressure on oil prices from the Russian invasion of Ukraine are being felt at the petrol pump and at the supermarket. This Budget responds to these immediate challenges facing New Zealanders while also looking ahead. The here and now matters, but so too does tomorrow and making sure that we provide for a secure future. This Budget is about both—a careful balance to provide economic security into the future and make sure we invest for what is needed now without adding to the drivers of inflation.",19/05/2022 14:05
1152,a,Grant Robertson,"I will talk more about our long-term initiatives shortly, but first, I want to focus on our immediate challenges. I am acutely aware of the cost of living pressures that exist for many people, particularly those on low and middle incomes. While the current levels of inflation are expected to be temporary, this doesn't take away from the impact it is having on households and businesses. New Zealanders are not alone in feeling these pressures: recently, the US has recorded inflation of 8.5 percent; Canada, 6.7 percent; Germany, 7.3 percent; and, as of last night, the UK, 9 percent. The very latest OECD average was inflation of 8.8 percent in March, putting New Zealand about middle of the pack. Such international comparisons, however, do not diminish the impact on New Zealanders who are currently struggling to deal with rising costs.",19/05/2022 14:05
1153,a,Grant Robertson,"The Government, throughout COVID, has supported households and businesses. More than $20 billion was provided in across-the-board support from the wage subsidy scheme, resurgence support, and COVID support payments. This has kept many people in work: 62 percent of all jobs were supported in 2020 by the wage subsidy scheme, and 47 percent in 2021.",19/05/2022 14:05
1154,a,Grant Robertson,"In response to the rapid spike in global oil prices following the war in Ukraine, we moved quickly in March to reduce the fuel excise by 25c a litre. For a family that fills up an average car every week, that represents up to $17 per tank, or more than $220 worth of support over the three months. Road-user charges were similarly reduced and public transport prices halved for the same period. These measures were on top of changes we made to increase income support for low and middle income families from 1 April this year, including a third lift in weekly main benefit rates following those in 2020 and 2021. The changes we have made since coming into Government mean that 364,000 people who receive income support are better off by an average of $109 per week. For those with children, they are better off by an average of $175 per week.",19/05/2022 14:05
1155,a,Grant Robertson,"As we move through these next few months, further targeted support is being provided for low and middle income New Zealanders. The resumption of the winter energy payment from 1 May is providing this for superannuitants and those on income support, with at least $80 per month from the beginning of May until the end of September.",19/05/2022 14:05
1156,a,Grant Robertson,"But the increasing cost of living is affecting those on middle incomes as well. To provide targeted support to a wider group, through this Budget the Government is investing more than $1 billion in a cost-of-living package targeted at low and middle income households. The package includes: an extension to the reduction of fuel excise duty introduced in March, by two months until mid-August; an extension of the road user charges cuts introduced in April, until mid-September; and an extension of half-price public transport fares introduced on 1 April, until the end of August. I can also announce today that, from September, we will introduce Community Connect, to extend half-price public transport to the more than one million community services card holders on a permanent basis. In addition to helping reduce costs for households, the public transport price cuts will also further our climate change and emissions reduction objectives. ",19/05/2022 14:05
1157,a,Grant Robertson,"We will also provide short-term targeted support to low and middle income New Zealanders through a $350 cost of living payment, across three monthly instalments from August 1. This works out to about $27 per week for an estimated 2.1 million New Zealanders. This payment will be available to people aged 18 and over who earn below $70,000 per annum, based on last year's tax data, and who are not eligible for the winter energy payment.",19/05/2022 14:05
1158,a,Grant Robertson,"We are well aware that this is only a contribution to the increased costs that people are facing, but it is a targeted way we can support people through this challenging period while not excessively exacerbating inflation. The payment has been set at half of the couple rate of the winter energy payment and is a recognition of the impact of inflation on a wider group of New Zealanders than those currently eligible for the winter energy payment. As a result of both the winter energy payment and the cost of living payment, 81 percent of working-age New Zealanders are being given temporary support to deal with cost of living pressures. ",19/05/2022 14:05
1159,a,Grant Robertson,"The Budget provides further important changes that will support those on low incomes. Budget 2022 will change how sole-parent beneficiaries receive child support payments. These payments will be directly passed on as income to sole parents receiving benefits from 2023, giving them more money to help their families and whānau. This change is estimated to lift between 6,000 and 14,000 children out of poverty.",19/05/2022 14:05
1160,a,Grant Robertson,"We are also delivering on a manifesto commitment by more than trebling the level of dental grants available to low income earners to $1,000 per annum. Criteria changes will ensure these grants can be used for multiple visits for immediate and essential care.",19/05/2022 14:05
1161,a,Grant Robertson,"While much of the inflation being experienced in New Zealand is driven by forces beyond our shores, we are also focused on addressing the supply constraints and other underlying issues that fuel it. This includes increasing labour supply through our immigration rebalance, and reducing our reliance on volatile commodities like oil by decarbonising our transport fleet through initiatives like the clean car discount.",19/05/2022 14:05
1162,a,Grant Robertson,"We are also committed to boosting competition in New Zealand's grocery sector to ensure people pay fair prices for food and other basics. Today, we are introducing legislation that will remove barriers to new retailers entering the market. Specifically, this will prohibit the restrictive covenants on land that major grocery retailers use to limit site availability for competitors. Such covenants will be prohibited immediately once the bill comes into effect, and I anticipate that competitors can begin to consider new sites shortly thereafter.",19/05/2022 14:05
1163,a,Grant Robertson,"There are other measures the Government will take in response to the Commerce Commission's recommendations, but this is one thing that can be done relatively simply and quickly. Overall, the cost of living package in Budget 2022 represents a targeted response to the pressures being faced by low and middle income households and provides support without making the cause of the problem worse.",19/05/2022 14:05
1164,a,Grant Robertson,"Moving to our longer-term challenges and opportunities, Budget 2022 marks an historic milestone in tackling climate change. Climate change is the most pressing long-term challenge we face. It will have a significant impact on New Zealanders' living standards in the coming years, impacting the natural environment, our health, and our economic, social, and cultural wellbeing.",19/05/2022 14:05
1165,a,Grant Robertson,"Recent reports that have highlighted worsening predictions for sea-level rise remind us again that we must act now for the sake of future generations. The action required presents opportunities to increase our economic security as we develop new low-emissions industries and the knowledge and skills needed to transition to a high-wage, low-emissions economy. New Zealand's reputation in the world, and the brand on which we trade, is tied to the action we take on environmental issues, including climate change.",19/05/2022 14:05
1166,a,Grant Robertson,"Mitigating and adapting to climate change requires a sustainable, forward-looking response and significant investments across multiple Budgets. To address this, we have established the Climate Emergency Response Fund with an initial $4.5 billion down payment from the expected cash proceeds from the emissions trading scheme (ETS).",19/05/2022 14:05
1167,a,Grant Robertson,"For Budget 2022, investments are focused on mitigation, particularly initiatives to deliver actions in the emissions reduction plan. In future, the criteria will be extended to include adaptation. As announced earlier this week, the CERF investments for Budget 2022 total $2.9 billion and include a strong focus on transport initiatives. These include $569 million to support low-income households to shift to low-emissions alternatives when scrapping a vehicle, and $375 million to reduce reliance on cars and support the uptake of active and shared transport modes.",19/05/2022 14:05
1168,a,Grant Robertson,"There are also significant climate-focused energy and industry investments, including $653 million to fund further decarbonisation, including increasing the scope of the Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry Fund to support businesses to shift to low-carbon energy sources, and $73 million to deliver more insulation and heating retrofits for low-income homeowners by extending the Warmer Kiwi Homes programme.",19/05/2022 14:05
1169,a,Grant Robertson,"In the agricultural sector, climate investments include $339 million of funding for a centre for climate action in agriculture to support innovation and research to reduce emissions, and $6 million for the implementation of an agricultural emissions pricing scheme, based on the outcomes of the Primary Sector Climate Action Partnership—He Waka Eke Noa.",19/05/2022 14:05
1170,a,Grant Robertson,"In the forestry sector, $91 million is allocated to reduce the use of coal and other carbon-intensive fuels and materials by increasing woody biomass availability, and $145 million to create large-scale native forests as carbon sinks, to offset emissions in other sectors where abatement is difficult.",19/05/2022 14:05
1171,a,Grant Robertson,"The Government's emissions reductions plan will help us meet the carbon budgets set by the climate commission. They are achievable but will require all sectors to play their part. They will also require sustained investment. Treasury has updated its forecasts for ETS cash proceeds by a total of $800 million, and the Government has agreed to use this increase to top up the fund, leaving $1.5 billion remaining. We will review the size of the fund on a regular basis, with the next opportunity being the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update in December.",19/05/2022 14:05
1172,a,Grant Robertson,"The climate investments we've announced in Budget 2022 are funded by those who pollute, not from increasing debt or other revenue. They will see the Government, in partnership with business, do the initial heavy lifting in our climate response and, in doing so, give households greater choice about how they participate in climate action.",19/05/2022 14:05
1173,a,Grant Robertson,"I would like to acknowledge our cooperation agreement partners, the Green Party, and in particular the Hon James Shaw for his role across two terms of Government in bringing this work together. It is no longer good enough to just talk the talk on climate action. At Budget 2022, we walk the walk—or take public transport or another sustainable mode of transport; a dad joke for Minister Shaw.",19/05/2022 14:05
1174,a,Grant Robertson,"COVID-19 has highlighted the need to reform New Zealand's health system and ensure we are delivering quality services nationwide in an equitable and sustainable way. Our health system is staffed by dedicated and talented health professionals, but the system in which they are working is fragmented, inefficient, and financially unsustainable. For too long, New Zealanders' access to health services has been a postcode lottery. For decades, we have seen inequalities grow in the health outcomes for Māori and Pacific peoples. Today, that changes.",19/05/2022 14:05
1175,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2022 provides the largest investment ever in our health system, with $11.1 billion in new funding to put that system on a sustainable financial footing. This will ensure that Health New Zealand and the Māori Health Authority are able to make the changes needed to deliver better health services to New Zealanders wherever they live. To set this system up for success, we need to change the way we provide funding for health.",19/05/2022 14:05
1176,a,Grant Robertson,"In recent years, district health boards have consistently run deficits, with funding unable to meet growing demand and address historic cost pressures. Relying on the annual Budget cycle for funding has made it difficult to plan for future investments and address long-term challenges in the health system. To address this, we are introducing a new multi-year funding model for health, beginning with two years of funding before eventually moving toward a three-year funding cycle from Budget 2024.",19/05/2022 14:05
1177,a,Grant Robertson,"The two-year transitional package agreed through Budget 2022 begins with an investment of $1.8 billion per annum, including funding to deal with the deficits of the previous system. This will be followed by a further $1.3 billion per annum from 2023. Unlike in previous Budgets, where cost pressures for specific services have had to be traded off against each other, delayed or partly funded, this general increase will allow Health New Zealand to take a central view and identify priorities for funding across the system. The transformation of our health system will take time, but these first investments will make significant progress towards a fully equitable, sustainable, and quality health system for the future.",19/05/2022 14:05
1178,a,Grant Robertson,"Within the funding allocated in Budget 2022, there is $488 million for primary and community care. This will roll out local models of care that are tailored to the populations they serve, as well as securing and developing the capacity and capability of Māori and Pacific healthcare providers.",19/05/2022 14:05
1179,a,Grant Robertson,"The investments for Māori healthcare providers contribute to a wider package of initiatives totalling $580 million across the health, social, and justice sectors, which contribute to Māori health and wellbeing—this includes $166 million for Whānau Ora providers to continue supporting more than 40,000 whānau.",19/05/2022 14:05
1180,a,Grant Robertson,"The Budget will also make the largest ever single contribution to Pharmac's medicines budget. We're investing $191 million over the next two years to make more medicines and other health treatments available. The two-year funding will align Pharmac with the new overall multi-year health funding allocation. Pharmac's total funding will be $1.2 billion, which is up 43 percent since we took office in 2017.",19/05/2022 14:05
1181,a,Grant Robertson,"There is significant support in Budget 2022 to secure the future of our ambulance services: $166 million over four years provides funding to add 48 more ambulances and 13 other vehicles to New Zealand's road ambulance fleet and to allow up to 248 more paramedics and front-line staff to be recruited; $90.7 million over four years will go towards New Zealand's air ambulance services—this includes the replacement of some ageing aircraft with modern, fit for purpose helicopters and at least one new helicopter with additional crew.",19/05/2022 14:05
1182,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2022 allocates $202 million to further improve New Zealanders' access to mental health and addiction services. This Budget focuses on improving care for those who have the highest needs. We're investing $100 million to increase the availability of specialist mental health and addiction services and to strengthen existing services in targeted areas across the country. We're also continuing to invest in two programmes that support young people's mental health: Mana Ake, which provides mental wellbeing support for primary and intermediate school - aged students, and Piki, a pilot scheme which provides integrated mental health and addiction support for young people.",19/05/2022 14:05
1183,a,Grant Robertson,"We're also continuing our significant investment in hospitals and other health infrastructure, with an injection of a further $1.3 billion. This will include a further investment for the rebuild of Whangārei Hospital and the initial works to re-develop Nelson Hospital. This takes total health capital investment since Budget 2018 to more than $6.9 billion.",19/05/2022 14:05
1184,a,Grant Robertson,"In every Budget, there are always smaller projects that might get lost on the day but are very meaningful. To highlight just one example: this year, we're providing $7 million of funding for the operation of portable retinal cameras to ensure equitable access for screening premature babies, to address one of the leading causes of blindness.",19/05/2022 14:05
1185,a,Grant Robertson,"In total, around a third of Budget 2022 investments are for health. This speaks to our priorities as a Government. Our vision is for all New Zealanders—no matter where they live or who they are—to have access to high-quality health services to support the best quality of life. I am proud to say that this Budget is a significant step towards making this vision a reality.",19/05/2022 14:05
1186,a,Grant Robertson,"In response to COVID-19, we went hard and we went early, an approach that has paid huge dividends. Key to this success was the establishment of the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund. This fund has allowed us to invest in crucial response functions and targeted supports that enable New Zealanders to weather and recover from the economic impacts of COVID-19. As our policy response to the pandemic evolves and we adjust to living with COVID-19, our fiscal response is evolving as well. Our COVID-19 response is increasingly part of standard Public Service delivery, so we no longer expect to need the funding flexibility that was essential early on. As a result, we have closed the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund. We are reprioritising the remaining funding and bringing future COVID-19 - related costs within standard Budget processes. We continue to have fiscal headroom to respond, as necessary, in the event of a major resurgence or a new variant. We are taking a prudent approach to that possibility by setting aside $1.2 billion so we can respond rapidly to any immediate public health needs related to COVID-19 that cannot wait until Budget 2023.",19/05/2022 14:05
1187,a,Grant Robertson,"The uncertain and volatile global economic situation highlights the need for an economic plan that supports diversification of the New Zealand economy, creates new products and services, and increases our resilience in an uncertain world. Our economic plan is to build a high-wage, low-emissions economy that provides economic security in good times and in bad.",19/05/2022 14:05
1188,a,Grant Robertson,"This Budget includes a substantial package to unleash the potential in our economy. We're funding the ongoing development of industry transformation plans (ITPs). ITPs bring industry players together to increase productivity and resilience. Budget 2022 invests $37 million for the Construction Sector Accord Transformation Plan to increase the productivity, capability, and resilience of our construction sector; $30 million for the Advanced Manufacturing ITP—this plan focuses on identifying existing and emerging points of comparative advantage and maximising our global brand and international connections; an additional $5 million for the Agritech ITP to build the skills and practices required to transform the sector into a sustainable and competitive export industry; and $20 million for the digital ITP to grow the software-as-a-service sector and ensure that we grow the skills and talent we need to create more high-wage jobs.",19/05/2022 14:05
1189,a,Grant Robertson,The Budget also recognises the importance of the tourism sector to rebuild in a sustainable way. An innovation programme for tourism is being created by reprioritising funding not required from earlier emergency support. It will be designed with the sector to ensure it targets investment to where we can truly innovate and develop our tourism offering.,19/05/2022 14:05
1190,a,Grant Robertson,"Small businesses are a key component in the transition to a high-wage, low-emissions economy. We are setting aside $100 million of capital funding for a business growth fund being developed alongside New Zealand's major banks.

1191,a,Grant Robertson,"We know that, when our regions do well, all of New Zealand benefits. To help the people, businesses, and industries based in the regions reach their full potential, we are fully funding the $200 million Regional Strategic Partnership Fund to invest in local projects tailored to a region's particular needs and advantages. To further help those in the regions, we are fulfilling another manifesto commitment by investing $60 million to improve broadband infrastructure in the worst-served areas, enabling stronger connections and greater productivity.",19/05/2022 14:05
1192,a,Grant Robertson,"This Government is focused on delivering better infrastructure, and that is a key component of our vision for a high-wage, low-emissions economy. Our first 30-year New Zealand Infrastructure Strategy from Te Waihanga, the New Zealand Infrastructure Commission, shows that, if we continue on the path of the past four decades, we will not be able to meet our future infrastructure needs. Under-investment in our crucial infrastructure is one of New Zealand's greatest long-term economic challenges. We have dedicated more than $60 billion to infrastructure over the next five years, but that alone is not enough. We need to be smarter about the way we plan, deliver, and use our infrastructure. This will mean getting more from the infrastructure that we do build, reducing costs, and prioritising for the greatest impact.

1220,Speech,James Shaw," I wish to make a ministerial statement relating to the emissions reduction plan. Yesterday the Government released Te hau mārohi ki anamata: Towards a productive, sustainable and inclusive economy. This is Aotearoa New Zealand's first statutory emissions reduction plan under the Climate Change Response Act 2002 as amended by the zero carbon bill in 2019. As a result of the amendment, the Climate Change Response Act has as its purpose to provide a framework by which New Zealand can develop and implement clear and stable change policies that (1) contribute to the global effort under the Paris agreement to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and (2) allow New Zealand to prepare for and adapt to the effects of climate change. ",17/05/2022 14:02
1221,a,James Shaw,"The zero carbon amendment bill passed unanimously, which is a great credit to parliamentarians across the House. That bipartisan accord means that New Zealanders do now enjoy a sense of certainty and predictability about the overall framework that guides climate policy over the coming decades. That includes the commitment to the 1.5 degree temperature threshold and the long-term emissions reductions targets to 2050. Following the House's strong bipartisan endorsement last week, this also now includes the first three emissions budgets that act as stepping stones towards those 2050 targets. In total, there will be six emissions budgets and emissions reductions plans to take us out to 2050. Each budget will act as a stepping stone to lower emissions and each plan will include the necessary policies and strategies to meet that budget. ",17/05/2022 14:02
1222,a,James Shaw,"Our first emissions budget requires us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by a further 11.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over the course of the next four years. Our strategy to achieve this and to lay the groundwork for the second and third emissions budgets is based on five principles. It starts with what we need to do to play our part in a worldwide effort to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius so that current and future generations are protected from the floods, fires, droughts, and storms of a changing climate. That flows into our Tiriti o Waitangi commitments and empowering Māori to respond to the particular risks and opportunities for Māori and the Māori economy alongside an equitable transition that brings everyone with us and leaves no one behind, and working with nature to solve the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis together. Those considerations then drive the ultimate outcome, which is a productive, sustainable, and inclusive economy that works for everyone.",17/05/2022 14:02
1223,a,James Shaw,"The challenge that we have in front of us is as urgent and as important as it has ever been. The science tells us that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels gives us the best chance of avoiding the worst effects. As temperatures have already risen more than 1 degree, we must act now to prevent further atmospheric warming and the catastrophes that accompany it. ",17/05/2022 14:02
1224,a,James Shaw,"I acknowledge that all parties in this Parliament have different policy prescriptions for reaching our shared goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But now that we have a plan, the task for our Government is to make that happen and the task for all of us in this House is to make the next plan even better. Thank you, Mr Speaker.",17/05/2022 14:02
1225,Speech,Chris Hipkins," I move, That this House approve the following orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020: COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Amendment Order (No 3) 2022 (SL 2022/76), COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations) Amendment Order (No 3) 2022 (SL 2022/77), COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Amendment Order (No 5) 2022 (SL 2022/83), COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework and Vaccinations) Amendment Order 2022 (SL 2022/89), COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Amendment Order (No 4) 2022 (SL 2022/91), COVID-19 Public Health Response (Self-Isolation Requirements and Permitted Work) Amendment Order (No 3) 2022 (SL 2022/106), and COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Amendment Order (No 6) 2022 (SL 2022/107).",17/05/2022 15:20
1226,a,Chris Hipkins,"I think the Parliament is now well acquainted with the process of approving orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act. As the Minister responsible for that Act, I sign orders that implement the Government's decisions when it comes to COVID-19 restrictions and policies or the removal thereof. They then come into immediate effect, or almost immediate effect, and then the Parliament has to approve those by motion in the House within 90 days. Today's motion approves seven orders that come into force on various dates or that came into force on various dates between 23 March and 14 April. ",17/05/2022 15:20
1227,a,Chris Hipkins,"As normal, I want to, as I have been, congratulate and thank the Regulations Review Committee for their thorough and diligent scrutiny of them. I'm pleased to say that this particular block of orders did not raise any concerns from the Regulations Review Committee, and I actually think that that is a marker of success in the sense that we have worked very collaboratively with the Regulations Review Committee to take on board the feedback they've given us throughout the process of putting these orders in place, to try and make the law as easy as possible to follow and to try and iron out inconsistencies or any issues of technicality that the committee has raised. So I thank them for their ongoing work. I think that that process has worked very well, and should a future Government find itself in a position where a similar legislative provision is required, I'd encourage them, whenever that may be, to continue to follow this approach. ",17/05/2022 15:20
1228,a,Chris Hipkins,"Some of these orders that we are confirming today have helped us to take pretty big strides in reconnecting New Zealand with the rest of the world. We've removed many of the restrictions that have been in place over the last two years. One of the orders that we're confirming today moved New Zealand from the red to the orange sittings in the COVID-19 Protection Framework. Another helped us to introduce the new traveller declaration system that requires people travelling to New Zealand to make a declaration and to have a traveller pass before they arrive here. The order also removed vaccination requirements for arrivals from the Ukraine to be vaccinated and have a pre-departure test, recognising that those coming to New Zealand from the Ukraine at the moment would possibly find it very difficult to comply with that requirement. ",17/05/2022 15:20
1229,a,Chris Hipkins,"Another one of the orders removed the requirement for certain persons to be vaccinated, something that has been the subject of a lot of discussion. It removed vaccination certificate rules, it removed outdoor capacity limits, but it did retain the requirement for a number of workers to wear medical-grade face coverings and it extended the face covering requirements to workers at indoor events, requiring certain workers to wear medical-grade masks. Those are the ones that we typically call the medical-grade masks—they're the paper ones that have a blue outer, which people should also be familiar with. It requires people to wear those at an orange setting. ",17/05/2022 15:20
1230,a,Chris Hipkins,"Other orders before the House today made minor changes to rules for managed isolation and quarantine, vaccination combinations, vaccination requirements for travellers from some Pacific countries, and changes to the red setting which no longer apply. The Health Committee is currently considering another notice of motion which is relevant to this one, which would extend the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 for a further six months. ",17/05/2022 15:20
1231,a,Chris Hipkins,"I'll be appearing before the Health Committee tomorrow in order to answer questions on that and other aspects of the COVID-19 response. I note that this will be my 10th appearance before the Health Committee on COVID-19 measures, and, in passing, I do note that so far over the last year, Ministers have made 126 appearances before select committees to discuss whatever matters those committees have wished to raise with them. A lot of those appearances have, of course, canvassed COVID-19 measures. I do note that that is somewhat of a contrast to the 39 appearances made by National Ministers in the last full year that they were in Government in 2016. ",17/05/2022 15:20
1232,a,Chris Hipkins,"It is my intention, or my hope, that I won't have to bring many more of these motions to the House for approval. We do need to recognise, however, that the global pandemic still continues and that things continue to be unpredictable. The COVID-19 Public Health Response Act has underpinned our ability to respond quickly as new events have emerged and as the situation has required that. It has allowed us to emerge from the early stages of the pandemic with a strong economy, record low rates of unemployment, and a number of businesses still operating that might not otherwise had they not been able to be supported in the way that we have. ",17/05/2022 15:20
1233,a,Chris Hipkins,"We still don't know what's around the corner, so we've still got a little bit of water to flow under the bridge yet, but I am feeling relatively confident that we won't see the speed of change and the rapid nature of the orders process that we saw in earlier phases of the pandemic, and that things should be a little more predictable from here forward. And so I commend this particular motion to the House.",17/05/2022 15:20
1234,Speech,Speaker," I regret to inform the House of the death on 10 May 2022 of the Hon Dr Richard Westwood Worth VRD, who represented the Epsom electorate from 1999 to 2005 and continued to serve as a list member until 2009.

1236,Speech,Eugenie Sage," I move, That the House take note of the report of the Environment Committee on the Inquiry into the Natural and Built Environments Bill. ",12/05/2022 9:00
1237,a,Eugenie Sage,"Very pleased, as chair of the Environment Committee, to start this debate on our inquiry into the exposure draft of the Natural and Built Environments Bill, or the NBEA. So the Resource Management Act (RMA) is the cornerstone of our environmental law in regulating the management of land, fresh water, air, the coast, and our territorial sea. Its overhaul and replacement with the NBEA and a strategic or spatial planning Act and the climate change adaptation Act is the biggest change in our environmental law in 30 years. And even though the draft bill, which the Environment Committee considered, was only a very small slice of one of the two bills to be introduced later this year, it's no surprise that our report last November ran to some 70 pages and with a revised bill attached after that.",12/05/2022 9:00
1238,a,Eugenie Sage,"I'd really like to thank the more than 3,000 individuals and organisations who submitted to the inquiry and the 301 people and organisations who presented to us and expanded on their submissions. The analysis and the thought, often unpaid, that went into those submissions and presentations helped shape our conclusions and our 37 recommendations. ",12/05/2022 9:00
1239,a,Eugenie Sage,"Also like to acknowledge the members of the Environment Committee for a shared commitment to improving the bill, the Ministry for the Environment officials' patience with seemingly endless Zoom meetings, Parliamentary Counsel Office for their insightful drafting, and our very capable select committee staff.",12/05/2022 9:00
1240,a,Eugenie Sage,"One of the former objectives is to make the resource management system less complex to standardise processes and to make them less costly. So the committee's recommendations here included recommending that Government and officials really carefully consider the extent to which the new legislation should retain and accommodate existing RMA terminology, definitions, and concepts, especially where these are defined in case law. The intent here was to reduce the uncertainty, which will come with new legislation.",12/05/2022 9:00
1241,a,Eugenie Sage,"We've recommended a shift away from adversarial processes towards a more inquisitorial approach at both council and Environment Court level, and consideration of how to best support non-statutory conflict resolution processes, including tikanga-based processes on marae.",12/05/2022 9:00
1242,a,Eugenie Sage,"We wanted the use of digital tools improved, and central government, for example, could coordinate and fund an online portal to help councils follow Marlborough District Council's example in fully digitising their plans and properly formatting those so that they're easily accessible. ",12/05/2022 9:00
1243,a,Eugenie Sage,"So the 25 clauses of the draft bill that we considered were its preliminary provisions such as the interpretation section, its purpose, elements of the national planning framework, environmental limits, natural and built environment plans, and regional planning committees.",12/05/2022 9:00
1244,a,Eugenie Sage,"So, talking about the bill's purpose, as human beings our wellbeing is intimately connected to the health of te taiao. And the RMA's purpose of promoting sustainable management and its effects-based regime haven't prevented a decline in water quality in our rivers and aquifers, the ongoing loss of wetlands, or car-dependent urban sprawl. So we heard from submitters, including the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, who considered that the bill's purpose clauses were not strong enough to prevent further degradation of nature and they'd be little improvement on the RMA. They suggested that much more directive and active language is needed, which prioritises upholding Te Oranga o te Taiao and protecting and, where possible, restoring the ecological integrity of the natural environment.",12/05/2022 9:00
1245,a,Eugenie Sage,"So the majority of the committee didn't recommend any substantive changes to clause 5, which sets out the purpose of the bill, which is to enable Te Oranga o te Taiao to be upheld, but we did make considerable changes around other causes in Part 2. We also recognised the need for further conversations between the Crown and Māori about how te reo terms such as Te Oranga o te Taiao and Māori concepts are used in the bill, whether they're defined, and what further direction is needed to give effect to the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. ",12/05/2022 9:00
1246,a,Eugenie Sage,"So the changes that we recommended related to clause 5 were particularly around environmental limits. We spent quite a lot of time on that. We wanted to ensure that environmental limits are set for the purpose of protecting ecological integrity and/or human health, while noting that the National Planning Framework (NPF) and natural and built environment plans rather than individual consents are the major tool to achieve protection and restoration of nature.",12/05/2022 9:00
1247,a,Eugenie Sage,"We recommended that the bill express environmental limits in two ways: either as the minimal biophysical state of the environment, or the maximum harm or stress that could be permitted. To avoid a race to the bottom and to encourage improvement in the health of nature where it's been degraded, the bill should enable the Minister for the Environment to set targets as a pathway for improvement. ",12/05/2022 9:00
1248,a,Eugenie Sage,"It's been widely agreed that a major failure of the RMA has been in implementation and the absence of national policy, national environmental standards, and national direction until relatively recently. Councils were just left to work out how the RMA should be best applied. So the National Planning Framework is intended to consolidate and build on existing national directions, such as the national policy statement on freshwater. Here, the committee recommended an expanded purpose for the National Planning Framework and that it would be mandatory rather than optional for the NPF to prescribe environmental limits on at least six environmental domains, from air quality to estuaries, as well as providing direction on matters of national significance. ",12/05/2022 9:00
1249,a,Eugenie Sage,"We heard a strong desire from submitters to retain local democratic input and community engagement in plan making. So district plans, regional plans, and regional policy statements are all going to be scooped up into one regional natural built environment plan, which will be a massive exercise. Submitters sought stronger representation of councils on the proposed regional planning committees which will prepare and maintain these plans. So the committee recommended that the bill clearly set out a substantial role for local authorities, and I'm aware that the local government resource management reform steering group has made some further recommendations here. ",12/05/2022 9:00
1250,a,Eugenie Sage,"Moving on to urban trees, more than two-thirds of the submissions to the inquiry—over 2,000 submissions—were about urban trees. Submitters reminded us that these trees are an essential part of a well-functioning urban environment, and they provide shade, reduce the heat island effect, and reduce soil erosion and stormwater run-off. The changes that the National Government made in 2013, submitters told us, had had a devastating effect on urban tree cover. So officials indicated that the issue of urban trees would be considered—because it wasn't in front of us—but we've yet to see the results of that. ",12/05/2022 9:00
1251,a,Eugenie Sage,"The replacement of the RMA and the introduction and passing of the Natural and Built Environments Act and the Strategic Planning Bill by the Parliament is a legacy project for the Government. I would encourage Government and the Ministry for the Environment to update the public on progress so that New Zealanders are better informed about the evolving shape of these two critical bills. This could include outlining their thinking on where the legislation is likely to differ from the recommendations in the Randerson review, how the regional planning committees will be structured and operate, what is proposed for urban trees, and how it is intended to ensure high-quality urban environments with the removal of the concept of amenity values, which has been part of the RMA. ",12/05/2022 9:00
1252,a,Eugenie Sage,"This would give stakeholders and people time to absorb and consider the changes proposed and raised any potential red flags. The Government response to the select committee report, which the Ministry for the Environment released earlier this year, for example, provided no indication of whether any or all of the select committee recommendations would be progressed. Speaking now as a Green MP, the Green Party is also interested in whether it's intended to respond to the evolving international discussion about the rights of nature and the growing campaign to establish an international crime of ecocide for harm to nature. ",12/05/2022 9:00
1253,a,Eugenie Sage,"There's been a large amount of public money, thinking, and parliamentary time which is going into the RMA reform exercise, with the expectation that changing our law will actually change the outcomes for the environment and human wellbeing. Transparency will help build trust, and building trust helps contribute to good policy and good law. ",12/05/2022 9:00
1254,a,Eugenie Sage,"So it was a very substantial inquiry. Very grateful for everyone who contributed, and we look forward to seeing the two bills later this year. Thank you. ",12/05/2022 9:00

The correct result is Ayes 77, Noes 42. The record will be corrected accordingly.",11/05/2022 15:04

1259,Speech,Speaker," Members, on 14 April 2022, the House resolved that a respectful Address be presented to Her Excellency the Governor-General commending to Her Excellency the alterations in the appropriations for the 2021/22 financial year in respect of Vote Audit, Vote Ombudsmen, and Vote Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, and the estimates of expenses and capital injection for the 2022/23 financial year in respect of those votes. The proposed Address is available on the Table of the House. The question is that the address be adopted.",10/05/2022 15:12

1261,Speech,Andrew Little," Thank you, Mr Speaker. I move, That, pursuant to section 4A of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975, this House approve the Misuse of Drugs (Classification and Presumption of Supply) Order 2022, made under section 4 of that Act.",5/05/2022 15:06
1262,a,Andrew Little,"This is a reasonably technical motion that, with the approval of Parliament, allows then the order to be promulgated and for drugs listed in the order to then appear in the appropriate schedule in the Misuse of Drugs Act. This is a measure designed to provide protection from harm in the face of a growing presence or risk of presence of the drugs listed so that our communities and our people are kept safe from them. ",5/05/2022 15:06
1263,a,Andrew Little,"The nature of the Misuse of Drugs Act does attract some commentary from some quarters as, amongst other things, it is about making sure that certain substances are appropriately classified and, with the appropriate level of classification reflecting the level of harm that they pose, then there are measures available if those drugs are abused or improperly used.",5/05/2022 15:06
1264,a,Andrew Little,"These orders providing for the classification of drugs in these circumstances are on the basis of advice from the Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs, and their judgment is that, of the drugs listed in the order, the current controls and restrictions on them do not adequately reflect the potential harms and risks that they pose. Approving this order means that we not only provide greater safety in relation to the presence of these particular drugs in our community but meet our international obligations under a variety of international instruments: the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. ",5/05/2022 15:06
1265,a,Andrew Little,"Some of these drugs are ones that are already present in New Zealand but now pose a level of risk that they need to be reclassified. Some are drugs that we know from intelligence are abroad and there is a much higher potential or risk that they will make their way into New Zealand. These are measures to make sure that, with the appropriate classification, it affords proper protection to New Zealanders who might otherwise be subject to their use or abuse. On that note, I commend the motion to the House.",5/05/2022 15:06
1266,Speech,Deputy Speaker, The question is that the motion be agreed to.,5/05/2022 15:09
1267,Speech,Speaker," Members, for reasons which might become obvious, I have delegated the response to an urgent debate application to the Deputy Speaker.",4/05/2022 14:56
1268,Speech,Deputy Speaker," Members, I have received a letter from David Seymour seeking to debate, under Standing Order 399, the issuance of trespass notices to a number of people who were present at the recent protest at Parliament. The member rightly notes that it is in the Speaker's power to issue trespass notices relating to the parliamentary precinct. An urgent debate may only be held if the matter involves the ministerial or administrative responsibility of the Government—Standing Order 399(2)(b). The Speaker is not a member of the Government, and the actions of the Speaker cannot be the subject of an urgent debate. I refer the member to Speaker's ruling 201/6, which states that an urgent debate ""is not a vehicle for addressing matters that are the responsibility of the Speaker."" In addition, Speaker Carter gave an extensive ruling on this issue on December 6 2016, which the member may find useful. The application is declined.",4/05/2022 14:57
1269,Speech,David Seymour," Point of order, Mr Speaker. Look, I find myself in a very difficult position because the letter referred not to the Speaker but to the Parliamentary Service and its security team, who are under the responsibility of the Minister for the Parliamentary Service, who is a Minister of the Crown. My letter did not refer to the Speaker. People at home don't know that because no one else has seen the letter, but I want to put that on record because I think people deserve to know that when they hear that ruling.",4/05/2022 14:58
1270,Intervention,Deputy Speaker," Just in response and further to the actual ruling, I again encourage the member to look at the ruling by Speaker Carter. As I said, he made an extensive ruling on the matter. There's a clear difference between a Minister that has been appointed on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and sworn in by the Governor-General, and the Speaker, who has been elected by this House, who also has, for the purposes of the Public Finance Act, ministerial responsibilities in certain areas. That does not make the Speaker a member of the Government. The purpose of—[Interruption] Yeah, I'm going to ask Mr David Bennett to stop interrupting while I'm on my feet, giving a ruling; this is a really important matter, so no more. As I was saying, that does not make the Speaker of the House a member of the Government, so I encourage members to read that ruling by Speaker Carter.",4/05/2022 14:58
1271,Speech,Chris Bishop," I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I seek leave for a special one-hour debate to happen forthwith, with the allocation of times and calls in the debate to follow the ordinary general debate speaking order as per Wednesday 5 May today.",4/05/2022 15:00
1272,Intervention,Deputy Speaker, Can you run that by me again? I want to know what the—,4/05/2022 15:00
1273,ContinueSpeech,Chris Bishop," I seek leave for a special debate to take place right now on the actions of the Speaker and parliamentary security, with the allocation of calls to follow the ordinary general debate calls as would take place this Wednesday.",4/05/2022 15:00
1274,Speech,Deputy Speaker," I'm going to take some advice on that. Yep, I'm not going to put that leave. That is out of order—I'm upon my feet; don't interrupt me while I'm making this ruling. If you think about every urgent debate in this House, the Minister responsible has a right to reply. The Speaker can never reply, and so that's actually out of order, and I'm not going to put that leave. And I'm not going to entertain any arguments about it, either.",4/05/2022 15:00
1275,Speech,Chris Bishop," I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I'm just seeking leave. The question of whether leave is granted is a question for the House. Mr Speaker, I put it to you, you should put the leave question. It's over to the Government to deny leave—or any other member of this House, the 120 MPs. But I'm seeking leave for the House to debate a serious matter that is not allowed to be debated through the urgent debate process—and I accept that ruling as requested by Mr Seymour. I'm just seeking leave for the House to have a one-hour debate on a very serious matter.",4/05/2022 15:01
1276,Speech,Deputy Speaker, And the way forward—as the member has done in previous occasions—is a motion on notice.,4/05/2022 15:02
1277,Speech,Gerry Brownlee," I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, it's interesting that you suggest that the member might progress things by way of a notice of motion. In the end, a notice of motion succeeds either because it comes up on the Order Paper or the House grants leave for it. Now, the point is that if the member were to put that notice of motion onto the Order Paper, it would be the same intent, the same wording, and the same desire to have a debate that would be expressed in the leave being requested of the House today. It seems to me that it is fundamentally a decision to stop the House investigating something that might be important to it—the House's decision in the end—when, in fact, there is no reason for that to occur. The advice that's been given is effectively counter to the decision not to accept the leave.",4/05/2022 15:02
1278,Intervention,Deputy Speaker," My response to that and to Mr Bishop is that Mr Bishop could seek leave to debate a motion, but he cannot seek the leave for the special debate.",4/05/2022 15:02
1279,Speech,David Seymour," I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I seek leave for the urgent debate I sought to take place forthwith, and, in addition—to overcome your earlier objection—for the Speaker to have a 15 minute right of reply at the end of it.",4/05/2022 15:03
1280,Speech,Deputy Speaker," No. That's just reinterpreting the letter, the ruling, and my subsequent responses, and that's not going to happen.",4/05/2022 15:04
1281,Speech,Chris Bishop," I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I seek leave to move a motion without notice relating to the holding of an urgent debate, forthwith, relating to the Speaker and the actions of Parliamentary Service security.",4/05/2022 15:04
1282,Speech,Deputy Speaker, Leave is sought for that matter. Is there any objection? There is objection. It will not be.,4/05/2022 15:04
1283,Speech,Speaker," I'd just like to indicate that there are quite a few people in the gallery who are not wearing masks. It's a requirement of being here that people wear masks. If staff can source some masks for people—I can see now just about everyone's got one, but they do have to wear them. And they don't wear them on their knees.",4/05/2022 17:40
1284,Interjection,Member, Unless they have an exemption.,4/05/2022 17:40
1285,ContinueSpeech,Speaker," Well, generally the people make application for exemptions here, and no one has—all right? Thank you. ",4/05/2022 17:40
1286,Speech,Speaker," I regret to inform the House of the death on 20 April 2022 of Ian Brooks, who represented the former Marlborough electorate from 1970 to 1975. He chaired the Education Committee from 1973 to 1975.",3/05/2022 14:04
1287,a,Speaker,"I desire, on behalf of this House, to express our sense of the loss we have sustained and our sympathy with the relatives of the late former member. I now ask members to stand with me and observe a period of silence as a mark of respect to his memory.",3/05/2022 14:04
1288,Speech,Poto Williams," Thank you, Mr Speaker. I seek leave to make a personal explanation to correct an answer to an oral question.",3/05/2022 14:05
1289,Interjection,Speaker, Is there any objection to that process taking place? There appears to be none.,3/05/2022 14:05
1290,ContinueSpeech,Poto Williams," In response to question No. 10 on 9 February, I answered that ""60,000 military-style weapons, also known as E category firearms, had been removed from circulation as part of the firearms buyback."" It was actually 60,000 prohibited firearms that were removed, of which 15,037 were classified as E category firearms.",3/05/2022 14:05
1291,Speech,Speaker," I have received a letter from Jan Logie seeking to debate, under Standing Order 399, the release of the Disability Commissioner's report inquiring into the support of disabled people and whānau during Omicron. This is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. The release of a report may warrant an urgent debate, but this must be exceptional, especially when working through a report's recommendations will take some time—Speaker's ruling 208/6. The Government's COVID response and the recommendations of this report cover several ministerial portfolios, an important one of which is health, and I note that members will have a chance to question the Minister during the annual review debate this evening. The release of this report does not warrant the setting aside of the business of the House today. The application is declined.",3/05/2022 15:12
1292,Speech,Chairperson," Members, the House is in committee for further consideration of the Appropriation (2020/21 Confirmation and Validation) Bill.

1295,a,Chairperson,"Each debate will be led off by the chairperson or another member of the committee that considered annual reviews most closely related to the Ministers' portfolios. A motion to report progress on a bill must be moved on a call not a point of order—Speaker's ruling 80/1. At the conclusion of the debate questions will be put, noting the committee reports on annual reviews and the provisions of the Appropriation (2020/21 Confirmation and Validation) Bill. There is no amendment for debate on these questions.",3/05/2022 15:14

1302,Speech,Deputy Speaker," I have received a letter from Brooke van Velden seeking to debate under Standing Order 399 an extradition decision by the Minister of Justice following a judgment of the Supreme Court. Under our system of Government, the decision of a court is not a matter for which any Minister of the Crown has responsibility, Speakers' ruling 202/3. The Minister of Justice's decision on this matter, which—Order! I'm on my feet, for those people talking. The Minister of Justice's decision on this matter, which has been reinstated by the court was made in 2016. The Minister has not made any further decisions on the matter. The urgent debate procedure is a means of debating matters that have occurred recently; it is not a means of debating matters that occurred many years ago or that might occur in the future, Speakers' ruling 205/3.

1305,Speech,Chris Hipkins," I move, That a respectful Address be presented to Her Excellency the Governor-General commending to Her Excellency the alterations to the appropriations for the 2021/22 financial year in respect of Vote Audit, Vote Ombudsmen, and Vote Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, and the estimates of expenses and capital injection for the 2022/23 financial year in respect of Vote Audit, Vote Ombudsmen, and Vote Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment.",14/04/2022 15:01
1306,a,Chris Hipkins,"This is an annual event for the House of Representatives, and it is probably one of the earliest parts of the Budget process for next year in the sense that the Offices of Parliament are the first to get their budgets, effectively, if you like, confirmed by the House. It concerns the appropriations for our three Officers of Parliament, the Controller and Auditor-General, the Ombudsmen, and the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment. It sets out any alterations to their appropriations for the current year. For every other Government department or entity, these are done through the Supplementary Estimates process, but the Offices of Parliament are handled differently, through this process. ",14/04/2022 15:01
1307,a,Chris Hipkins,"It also sets out the main appropriations for the three Offices of Parliament. They will ultimately be included in the Appropriation Bill that the Minister of Finance will introduce on Budget day. The process of having Parliament, effectively, confirm what they're getting before it's included in the Appropriation Bill maintains the independence of the Offices of Parliament, because it's not the Government that's setting the budget or agreeing to the alterations to those budgets for these entities; the Parliament as a whole does that, and it does that before the Budget is issued. So that's what this motion is all about. It helps to maintain the independence of the Offices of Parliament from the executive. ",14/04/2022 15:01
1308,a,Chris Hipkins,"So, briefly, just to canvass what the proposals involve. They have been examined by the Officers of Parliament Committee, which is chaired by the Speaker, and there has been cross-party agreement to the proposals put forward. The committee's report does explain in detail the proposals that are being put forward, but I'll just select a few of the key issues. The report of the Officers of Parliament Committee highlights the pressure that the Auditor-General has been under as a result of COVID-19. It's meant some of the audits have become increasingly complex and that audit revenue has been affected because there have been fewer staff available to do that work. COVID-19 has also increased the workload of the Ombudsmen. A large number of cases under investigation by the Ombudsmen relate to COVID-19 work. I know that—I'm one of the respondents to many of those cases. I also understand that the work of the Ombudsmen around the Protected Disclosures Act has also increased. The oversight of Oranga Tamariki will result in increased demands, and staff retention and office space have also been concerns, as they have been for the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment.",14/04/2022 15:01
1309,a,Chris Hipkins,"Finally, the three Offices of Parliament continue to provide excellent value for money, and they make a really important contribution to New Zealand's democratic systems of Government.",14/04/2022 15:01
1310,Speech,Deputy Speaker, The question is that the motion be agreed to.,14/04/2022 15:04
1311,Speech,Chris Hipkins," I move, That this House approve the following orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020: COVID-19 Public Health Response (Self-isolation Requirements and Permitted Work) Amendment Order 2022 (SL 2022/53), COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Amendment Order (No 4) 2022 (SL 2022/62), COVID-19 Public Health Response (Self-isolation Requirements and Permitted Work) Amendment Order (No 2) 2022 (SL 2022/63), and COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Amendment Order (No 2) 2022 (SL 2022/75).",14/04/2022 15:05
1312,a,Chris Hipkins,"Once more, I am asking the House to approve orders that have been made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act. There's fewer of them this time—and, actually, these ones are more up to date than some of the others that we've been confirming previously. We're getting to the point now where the orders that we are confirming by motion and in the House are the ones that have been progressively removing restrictions relating to COVID-19, and so many of these ones still remain in force.",14/04/2022 15:05
1313,a,Chris Hipkins,"So if I go through the four very briefly: the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Amendment Order (No 4) made the changes to the face covering requirements that apply at the red setting, and that included removing the requirements around face masks for outdoor gatherings—allowing people to gather outdoors without having to wear a mask—and the vaccination requirements for students enrolled at registered schools when participating in extracurricular activities. Those changes were designed to ensure that vaccine mandates and vaccine passes weren't preventing children from fully participating in school life.",14/04/2022 15:05
1314,a,Chris Hipkins,"The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Self-isolation Requirements and Permitted Work) Amendment Order (No 2) 2022 reduced the isolation period for COVID-19 cases from 10 days to seven days. It also extended the period in which someone is not required to isolate again after they've had COVID-19 up to three months, so it extended it from one month to three months. So if you've had COVID-19 in the last three months and a member of your household gets it, you don't have to self-isolate again.",14/04/2022 15:05
1315,a,Chris Hipkins,The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Amendment Order (No 2) 2022 removed the requirements for unvaccinated travellers to enter managed isolation and quarantine facilities for travellers from specific countries to be considered at low risk of transmitting COVID-19 on arrival in New Zealand. I should clarify that: that last one removes the requirements for New Zealand citizens.,14/04/2022 15:05
1316,a,Chris Hipkins,"The Regulations Review Committee examined all three of the orders that I've just mentioned and didn't raise any concerns about them. They did express concerns about the fourth, and that is the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Self-isolation Requirements and Permitted Work) Amendment Order 2022. That's the order that authorised the Director-General of Health to exempt COVID-19 cases from self-isolation requirements whilst undertaking specific work or travelling to undertake specific work, and it authorised the imposition of any conditions on that exemption. This was basically the ability for people in a limited number of circumstances who may have COVID-19 to go back to work where the risk of them not being at work was greater than the risk posed by them going to work when they had COVID-19. It's a very limited provision, and actually I don't think it has been used—certainly it hasn't been used extensively—if, in fact, it has been used at all.",14/04/2022 15:05
1317,a,Chris Hipkins,"But the main concern of the committee was that that one may have actually gone too far; it may have contradicted the intention of the Act, which was to limit the spread of COVID-19. I thank the committee for being very conscientious, but I would note that the reason for the exemption was slightly different. So I am satisfied that there isn't an inconsistency with the principal order, and I did write to the committee explaining the reasons why I thought that. The amendment did sit alongside the permitted work scheme. It was drafted with enough breadth that the obligations and duties of the permitted work scheme wouldn't automatically apply to workers and their employers. I noted that the director-general can impose conditions for managing risk when exercising the exemption power. So, once again, I do want to thank, however, the Regulations Review Committee for the very conscientious and thorough way they have gone through scrutinising and considering these.",14/04/2022 15:05
1318,a,Chris Hipkins,"The COVID 19 Public Health Response Act has underpinned our response to COVID-19. It has allowed the Government to respond quickly as COVID-19 has continued to evolve, and it's allowed New Zealand to emerge with a strong economy and record low levels of unemployment, and also, it should be pointed out, one of the lowest mortality rates in the world, downed to COVID-19. Having said that, our use of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act is narrowing, and I do think that we are now in that phase where we'll be looking very closely at orders that have been made under the Act to ensure that where there is a need for any of the provisions in them to be preserved on an ongoing basis, they are transferred to appropriate legislative vehicles so that the House is in a position soon to either allow the Act to lapse or, in fact, to repeal the Act.",14/04/2022 15:05
1319,a,Chris Hipkins,"So we're working through that process at the moment. We're not quite at the point where we can do that with complete confidence, because, of course, we don't know what's around the corner. We don't know whether future variants are going to have to throw up a new set of challenges that we may need to respond to. But we certainly know that many of the tools that we have been using previously are now sitting in abeyance and are not ones that we are likely to be using again any time soon.",14/04/2022 15:05
1320,a,Chris Hipkins,"So our use of the Act is winding back quite significantly. Many of the dilemmas and challenges posed by COVID-19 are ones that we can address through more regular legislative vehicles, and that is something that, as a Minister, I am committed to wherever possible we can do that—because I think the extraordinary powers in the Act, whilst justified at the time they were passed, the further away we get from the emergency crisis that we faced at the time, then the less justified that is and the more we need to look to use more regular parliamentary processes, including all of the scrutiny that goes with those. And certainly I am committed to getting back to that point as soon as we're able to do that.",14/04/2022 15:05

1338,Speech,Assistant Speaker," Members, earlier this afternoon, in the debate on the Rotorua District Council (Representation Arrangements) Bill, there was a speech by a member which expressed some strongly held views. I am aware, and it is well known, that different parties in this House do hold genuinely held views around the policies of some of the parties. Some of those may be suggested to be racist in nature. However, there is a freedom of speech—strong freedom of speech—interest in members being able to express their views in this House. But that, of course, does have to be balanced by members calling other members racist. That will lead to disorder, and it doesn't in any way assist the order and the debate of this House. I want to call on, finally, Speaker's ruling 37/4, where it says, ""It is incumbent on all members to treat the privilege of free speech in the House with the utmost respect and to use it only in the public interest"". Members, I'm happy to take another call, but I will have to cut the member off at five past six.",6/04/2022 17:56

Just to explain what I'm seeking leave for, it was discovered earlier today that there was a typographical error in one of the titles of the orders to be approved by the House, and so this leave is simply correcting the title of the order in the motion before I move the motion.",29/03/2022 21:17
1355,Interjection,Assistant Speaker, Is there any objection to that course of action being followed? There is none.,29/03/2022 21:17
1356,ContinueSpeech,Chris Hipkins," Thank you, Mr Speaker. I move, That this House approve the following orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020: ",29/03/2022 21:17
1357,a,Chris Hipkins,"This is a regular fixture for the House at the moment as we deal with a global pandemic and as we particularly enter a phase of the global pandemic where things have been moving and changing at a fairly steady clip. Under the COVID-19 public health legislation, the Government is able to move quickly in order to put in place and in order to remove certain restrictions, certain rules, and certain processes that are required for our management of the COVID-19 response.",29/03/2022 21:17
1358,a,Chris Hipkins,"This motion today approves 11 orders that have come into force on various dates between 3 February and 2 March this year. Though none of these orders are more than two months old, it is worthy to note that some of them have already been amended or replaced. A significant number of the provisions in the orders that we're confirming today are actually now obsolete, which I think shows how nimble and flexible and responsive our overall response to managing COVID-19 has been and how it will continue to be.",29/03/2022 21:17
1359,a,Chris Hipkins,"We are moving pretty rapidly through the post-peak plan, and life is starting to return to something that feels a lot more normal. So aspects of the response that are covered in the orders today include changes around the rules for face coverings—those still largely remain in place; reductions in period of isolation and quarantine—most of those have now been superseded; changes in some of the rules for people who are self-isolating—some of those do continue in place; the loosening of some travel restrictions—in fact, there has been a much, much more liberal loosening of travel restrictions since those orders were put in place; and the lifting of the requirement to self-isolate or for managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) for some travellers arriving in the country—and I would note that, in fact, again there's been a significant extension of that since those orders were put in place.",29/03/2022 21:17
1360,a,Chris Hipkins,"So the great majority of the amendments that these orders brought about were to ease restrictions as part of our managed transition, as we wound back many of the restrictions and many of the aspects of our COVID-19 response. There are some other significant ones still to come before the House, including removing vaccine pass requirements, removing vaccine mandates, and the changes that we've made to the traffic light system. Those will be covered in a subsequent motion; they've yet to be reviewed by the Regulations Review Committee.",29/03/2022 21:17
1361,a,Chris Hipkins,"I do want to acknowledge the work of the Regulations Review Committee in very conscientiously going through all of the orders that I have made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act and identifying a range of very useful questions, some of substance, some of style, but all of them, I think, underpinning that the committee has not in any way regarded this as a rubber stamp exercise. It has been a very important part of our continual review and improvement cycle. Often issues that have been identified by the Regulations Review Committee have been picked up on the next iteration of the orders in question. These orders have regularly been amended, regularly been updated, and are regularly changing; so the suggestions and the feedback from the Regulations Review Committee have often been incorporated.",29/03/2022 21:17
1362,a,Chris Hipkins,"The committee was particularly concerned, for example—just to highlight a few of the examples, but to highlight one—that a provision that was designed to mean that you wouldn't necessarily need to turf someone out of an MIQ facility in the middle of the night could result in people having to stay at an MIQ facility for longer than they might otherwise be required to, and that wasn't the intention of the order. The intention of the order was simply to make sure that, if somebody had nowhere else to go, they were able to stay there, because under the old order they would have had to be turfed out. So what we had to do was make sure that we got the balance right there, between saying, ""Yep, you can stay if you need to stay for a bit longer, but you're under no obligation to do that."" So, I think, with the exchange that we had with the committee, we were able to actually provide even better clarity in the next iteration of the order, which, of course, is now superseded because no one's going into MIQ now in the way that they were before. So I think that is a really good example of how the committee was able to contribute constructively to the process in order to keep improving these orders.",29/03/2022 21:17
1363,a,Chris Hipkins,"The orders—I do want to again acknowledge that they were often drafted and put in place with a sense of urgency because they were responding to a particular situation, a particular series of events, and so there has been ongoing, regular improvement as the opportunity has allowed.",29/03/2022 21:17
1364,a,Chris Hipkins,"In regard to the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Self-isolation Requirements and Permitted Work) Order of 2022, the committee was concerned that people who had to go into quarantine because they were unable to self-isolate in appropriate surroundings might face greater restrictions than they would if they were in self-isolation. We were able to explain that this may reflect the wider public health circumstances of why the person needed to go into MIQ facilities in the first place, and there are provisions there that allow for them to leave early, as that is required. The good news is that most of that, as I said, is now redundant, because we've moved to a new phase where the use of MIQ now has significantly diminished and, in fact, for most of those in MIQ—and there's very, very few—it is because they are in a particular category. So, for those who are interested in MIQ, as of today it's a couple of hundred people; mostly refugees, people who are coming from other parts of the world where they need a place to land when they get into the country, effectively—that is who MIQ are accommodating in their facilities at the moment.",29/03/2022 21:17
1365,a,Chris Hipkins,"The Regulations Review Committee, I think in their diligent scrutiny, looked right at the detail of some of the orders, including, I'm told, a detailed discussion of what ""contactless delivery"" actually is. I can say that the Cabinet committee had very similar conversation as we've unfolded our COVID-19 response over the last two years. So I welcome those kinds of conversations.",29/03/2022 21:17
1366,a,Chris Hipkins,"In May—so we're not far away from May now—it will be two years since the House passed the bill that became the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act of 2020. The powers given by that Act have given the Government the ability to move quickly to respond to the challenges that COVID-19 has brought about, and we've continued to evolve as the response to the virus has needed to evolve. It has been a big part of us being able to come through the global pandemic in a very strong position. We've got a strong economy, we have record low unemployment levels, and we are now in a very strong position to accelerate our recovery from COVID-19. It has been the orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act that have put us in that position.",29/03/2022 21:17
1367,a,Chris Hipkins,"But I also want to acknowledge, given that—I'm hoping—there may not be many more of these motions in the House, that there have been some really difficult trade-offs that have been involved in the response. There have been limitations on people's rights and freedoms—there's been no question about that. For many people, that's resulted in some hardship. So I want to acknowledge that, and I also want to acknowledge that I think everyone is feeling a degree of relief that we are getting to the point where our restrictions are much fewer than they have been for much of the response. We are returning to something that is much more normal. I look forward to continuing along that particular path.",29/03/2022 21:17
1368,Speech,Grant Robertson, I seek leave to move a motion without notice to congratulate the New Zealand Paralympic Winter Games team.,16/03/2022 14:00

1370,ContinueSpeech,Grant Robertson," I move, That this House congratulate the New Zealand Winter Paralympic Team for their outstanding achievements at the Beijing Winter Paralympics.",16/03/2022 14:00
1371,a,Grant Robertson,"With one gold, one silver, and two bronze medals, this was the most successful Paralympic Winter Games for New Zealand in 20 years. This was the biggest Paralympic Winter Games to date, so for the three person New Zealand team of Adam Hall, Corey Peters, and Aaron Ewen to win a total of four medals is quite remarkable. All three athletes can be very proud of their Paralympics campaign, which saw Corey Peters win gold in the men's downhill sitting and silver in the men's super-G sitting, and Adam Hall won a bronze medal in the men's slalom and in the super combined event, the most technical of the alpine skiing disciplines. New Zealand's newest Paralympian, Aaron Ewen, finished ninth in the men's slalom, a brilliant achievement in his first Paralympics.",16/03/2022 14:00
1372,a,Grant Robertson,"Corey Peters' gold in particular was a remarkable achievement, given that that he hadn't competed in a downhill event for two years as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. He also missed the world championships two months ago after catching COVID himself. Adam Hall's bronze in the men's standing slalom was described by commentators as ""millimetre perfect"", a reflection of his skill in this discipline.",16/03/2022 14:00
1373,a,Grant Robertson,"Qualifying for the Winter Paralympics is an enormous achievement, and it's made New Zealanders so proud to see the skill, determination, and hard work of our Paralympians come to fruition in Beijing. I'd also like to acknowledge the enormous contribution of chef de mission Jane Stevens, head coach Ben Adams, and assistant coach Scott Palmer to the team's success, as well as Paralympics New Zealand and their chief executive Fiona Allan and all the other team officials and support staff.",16/03/2022 14:00
1374,a,Grant Robertson,"The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, including the challenge of competing in Beijing without their friends and whānau on the side line for their events, meant that the support staff on the ground played a crucial role in our success at these Games. We have a great tradition of achievement at the Paralympics, and that also serves as a platform to challenge misconceptions about disabled people. These athletes have shown us that achievement can be limitless.",16/03/2022 14:00
1375,a,Grant Robertson,"Audiences for the Paralympic Winter Games continue to grow, and this was the first time New Zealanders were able to watch every Paralympic event, with TVNZ providing extensive coverage of the Games. Seeing the incredible performances across the full range of Paralympic winter sports has no doubt inspired disabled people and all New Zealanders. Again, I offer on behalf of the Government our congratulations to the members of the 2022 New Zealand Paralympic Winter Games team. They have made us extremely proud and are an inspiration to all New Zealanders.",16/03/2022 14:00
1376,Speech,Speaker, The question is that the motion be agreed to.,16/03/2022 14:03
1377,Speech,Speaker," Before we move on to petitions, I want to apologise to the members who were not invited to the ceremony this morning. That was my responsibility in that we were limited to 100 people, and I felt that it was better to invite members of the community who had been locked out, as well as members of Parliament and staff, to that ceremony. I will place on my record my thanks to Te Atiawa - Taranaki Whānui for the work that they did and helping us with the spiritual or emotional cleansing that goes along with the major physical decontamination of the site that has occurred. I will note that it is my intention to hold a ""grand reopening of the grass"", or something similar, possibly in early June, leading into Matariki, to which all members—COVID willing—will be invited.

1381,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Today, I stand here on behalf of New Zealand to acknowledge those who lost their lives in the terrorist attacks of March 15. We remember the 51 who were killed. We remember the injured. We remember the families who suffered such all-encompassing loss, the communities that embraced them, and we remember the moment where we felt like everything changed around us in an instant. ",15/03/2022 14:00
1382,a,Jacinda Ardern,"March 15 is a date in our collective national history where we learnt about the very worst and the very best of humanity. I have many reflections from the days and weeks following the attack. Almost every single one of them is a memory, or a lesson, from our Muslim community. We were reminded, not just in the aftermath of the attack but across the course of the sentencing process, of the strength of courage, unity, and determination of our Muslim community. ",15/03/2022 14:00
1383,a,Jacinda Ardern,"After the sentencing of the perpetrator of this horrific act, the Imam who stood at the front of Al Noor mosque, who watched his own community gunned down in the midst of prayer, who that night was in such shock that I recall when I spoke with him, he uttered but two words. That same man stood outside the court in Christchurch and said: ""Extremists represent hate. We represent love and compassion. Muslim and non-Muslim, people of faith and no faith. That is us, New Zealanders. We are very proud to be Muslims in New Zealand.""",15/03/2022 14:00
1384,a,Jacinda Ardern,"I will never fathom how it is in the wake of such hardship that our Muslim community have never shown disdain for their home, only pride and endless hope that it will be better. And that is what we owe them: better. Better comes through the systemic changes we make, like the changes to our laws. Six days after the attack, we announced the ban for all military-style semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles. This took 61,000 over-powered firearms, 2,800 modified firearms, and more than 200,000 firearms parts and accessories out of our communities. We have also established a dedicated firearms unit within Police to take over firearms regulatory activities, as well as a firearms registry to be set up from June 2023, which will address the 30-year deficit of information when it comes to knowing what legal firearms are out there in our communities.",15/03/2022 14:00
1385,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Ten days after the attack, a royal commission of inquiry was set up. It provided 44 recommendations to help our country to become the diverse, safe, inclusive country we hope for it to be. And, as such, a Ministry for Ethnic Communities is in place. Last year was the first annual hui on counter-terrorism and countering violent extremism. A national centre of research excellence for preventing and countering violent extremism is under way, and a Master's scholarship programme has launched. ",15/03/2022 14:00
1386,a,Jacinda Ardern,"In September last year, our Counter-Terrorism Legislation Bill passed into law, giving enforcement agencies greater powers to protect New Zealanders from terrorist activity and, in particular, ensuring the planning and preparation for a terrorist act is now a criminal offence—a long outstanding gap in previous laws that has now been fixed.",15/03/2022 14:00
1387,a,Jacinda Ardern,"But the work continues. ""Better"" means changing more than the law. The 17 minutes of terror that was live streamed on social media on March 15 remains available on some parts of the web despite measures to take it down. It's clear the terrorist had spent a great deal of time in the deepest recesses of the web, spiralling into extremism. And so two months after the attack, alongside France, we brought together heads of State and Government, and leaders from the tech sector, to adopt the Christchurch Call, to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online. ",15/03/2022 14:00
1388,a,Jacinda Ardern,"The Christchurch Call community now includes the member States of the European Union and the European Commission, the United States, Japan, Korea, and many others—55 countries in total—and UNESCO, and the Council of Europe. Ten online service providers have joined the call. The call's civil society advisory group represents more than 50 different organisations and individuals from around the world. We pledged to work with each other and with civil society to tackle the underlying causes of terrorism and violent extremism and to develop technical solutions that improve the online environment and make social media platforms less hospitable to terrorists and violent extremists. We have made substantial progress but the work continues, including on our own social cohesion agenda. ",15/03/2022 14:00
1389,a,Jacinda Ardern,"So we honour the memories of the 51 Shaheed who were killed with the actions we have taken to make our country a better home for all who live here. We acted as a country to deny infamy to the one who craved it, we acted as a country to cloak our Muslim community in love, and we acted as a country to strengthen tools both at home and around the world to violent extremism. But we must all, every day, work hard to do better, including to combat Islamophobia in Aotearoa New Zealand. ",15/03/2022 14:00

1391,Speech,Speaker," Members, before we move to oral questions, I just want to give members participating remotely three reminders. First, could members please use their first name and last name in Zoom so that the Clerk's operators can identify them. The operators can't admit people to the meeting if they do not know who they are, and using full names makes it faster to find members and unmute their microphones. With the exception of whips, who have special accounts, members need to be either in the Chamber or on Zoom. If they do both, it causes confusion. A reminder that unmuting and muting is controlled by operators. When I give the call, the member is unmuted. There is no need for the member to do anything, and trying to unmute themselves can cause the member to mute again.",15/03/2022 14:39

1396,Speech,Assistant Speaker, Thank you for that. Leave has been put to correct the vote. Is there any objection? There is none.,8/03/2022 17:44
1397,Speech,Chairperson," Members, before we proceed with this bill, I do need to correct the result of a party vote announced earlier this evening where the committee was considering the Commerce Amendment Bill. On the question that the Minister's amendment to Part 1, set out on Supplementary Order Paper 81 be agreed to, the result was announced as Ayes 65 and Noes 53. The correct result was Ayes 98, Noes 20. The record will be corrected accordingly. ",8/03/2022 21:22

1399,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Yesterday, the Police restored order on Parliament's grounds after an illegal occupation that lasted 23 days. As a result of that operation, 89 arrests were made, 40 police officers were injured, and 8 were admitted to hospital. In total, 600 police staff were involved in yesterday's events. There were 50 firefighters on site alongside Wellington Free Ambulance, who were treating those who were injured. And Parliament security once again supported all those involved, and have stood alongside the New Zealand Police throughout the occupation.",3/03/2022 14:03
1400,a,Jacinda Ardern,"To each of you, we say thank you. You were there throughout these events at a great risk to yourselves. Many of you were abused, some were injured, but you put your personal safety aside in order to look after others. And for that, we are very grateful. ",3/03/2022 14:03

1405,a,Jacinda Ardern,"I know many of us will have seen firsthand the events that unfolded on the grounds of Parliament yesterday afternoon. I was finishing a meeting on the other side of the building when I heard the sirens of the Fire Service. I stood in one of the Beehive offices as I watched the flames billow up from the front lawn of Parliament. The playground had been set alight. But as I was watching what was unfolding, Parliament continued. The debate in the House was being broadcast into the office, and as I watched the flames I could hear my colleague Barbara Edmonds speaking in the Chamber. She was talking about one of her family members who had recently become infected with COVID-19. It was her niece, who was only six weeks old; a newborn who struggled to breathe because of this pandemic that we are all working so hard to get safely on the other side of. It was hard to square. Here was a violent protest, full of anger, in response to measures that are designed to do no more than keep other people safe.",3/03/2022 14:03
1406,a,Jacinda Ardern,"I watched the first day the protest arrived here. I've watched protests come to Parliament over the years, I have received petitions, and I have spoken at many. And yet the day this one arrived, it was clear that it was different. There was an immediate focus on occupying the space. The rhetoric that came from the speakers they installed swung between benign to sometimes threatening. Many media who walked the grounds were either abused or, in some cases, chased away. It was a form of protest I did not recognise, and I found it hard to reconcile it with the reality of what all New Zealanders had faced in this pandemic and yet quietly got on with it.",3/03/2022 14:03
1407,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Barbara's niece spent time in hospital but is now recovering. And in a way, that's what we all want. For our vulnerable to be cared for, to get through, and to recover. And we will, but for now, we are in a very hard moment in time.",3/03/2022 14:03
1408,a,Jacinda Ardern,"For the first time in the two years since the start of the outbreak, New Zealanders are experiencing widespread COVID in the community. It is a period of disruption and risk. I saw a powerful message yesterday, shared by one of our health workers. It said that in all of the discussion about removing all of our current protections, they felt unseen—that with hundreds of hospitalisations and staff illness to contend with, the suggestion that we just give up and move on made them feel invisible. I know in this House none of us would wish any of our front-line workers to feel that way. They may not have occupied the front of Parliament, but they must occupy our thoughts.",3/03/2022 14:03
1409,a,Jacinda Ardern,"So my message today is simple. It is to condemn what happened here. Acts of violence cannot stand. It is to reinforce that this will always be a place where difference can be expressed and where that will be welcomed, but that should always be done with dignity and respect for the place upon which we stand; that everyone has sacrificed something in the last two years, but it has not been for nothing—it has been for each other. We just need to keep going a little longer.",3/03/2022 14:03
1410,a,Jacinda Ardern,"And finally, this too will pass. Where we are in the pandemic right now feels hard because it is, but things will change. Our people are coming home. Soon, tourists will return. Vaccine passes, mandates, restrictions—they will all change. There is reason to feel hopeful. ",3/03/2022 14:03

1416,a,Grant Robertson,"With two golds medals and one silver medal, placing New Zealand 17th on the medal table, the 2022 Winter Olympics were the country's most successful ever. Throughout the Winter Olympics, our team of 15 athletes, nine men and six women, competing in five sports, kept New Zealand enthralled with their gutsy performances which included, for the first time ever, two Winter Olympic gold medals from Zoi Sadowski-Synnott in the women's snowboarding Slopestyle and freestyle skier Nico Porteous who claimed victory in the men's Halfpipe competition.",2/03/2022 14:01
1417,a,Grant Robertson,"Zoi Sadowski-Synnott's additional silver medal in the women's snowboarding Big Air proved her dominance in her sport. Over the last four years since she won bronze in the women's Big Air at the 2018 Winter Olympics. This has made her, over the last four years and in this competition, one of the best snowboarders in the world. To win New Zealand's first Winter Olympic gold medal on Waitangi Day gave Zoi's achievement a special place in our sporting history. Her courage and determination to win on the final run of the competition was an extraordinary effort and a moment that New Zealanders will never forget.",2/03/2022 14:01
1418,a,Grant Robertson,"Not to be outdone by Zoi's achievements, 20-year-old Nico Porteous' gold medal saw him become the youngest New Zealander to win a Winter Olympics medal, overcoming some very windy and wild conditions during his competition. It was the culmination of an incredible four years since the 2018 games, where he also won bronze. Since that time, he has consistently been on the podium at international events and, as has Zoi as well, innovated with new tricks that pushed the boundaries of their sports.",2/03/2022 14:01
1419,a,Grant Robertson,"I'd also like to acknowledge all the other members of team who gave it everything and delivered fantastic performances, proving that we have raft of young talent making its way through the ranks and inspiring the next generation of Kiwi snow sports stars. We are immensely proud of our athletes who rose above the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the challenge of competing without friends and whānau on the side lines for their events, and we acknowledge those friends and whānau as well.",2/03/2022 14:01
1420,a,Grant Robertson,"I also want to acknowledge the support staff on the ground who played a critical role in the success of our team at these games. In particular, I'd like to mention chef de mission Martin Toomey and his team. Marty was formerly the chief executive of Snow Sports New Zealand and was part of the long-term planning and development that lay behind the success at these games. I want to acknowledge the whole snow sports New Zealand team, the New Zealand Olympic Committee, High Performance Sport New Zealand, and Sport New Zealand for their critical role in these stunning achievements.",2/03/2022 14:01
1421,a,Grant Robertson,"On behalf of the Government, our congratulations to all the members of the 2022 New Zealand Winter Olympic team. They have made us extremely proud and are an inspiration to all New Zealand. Now we can look forward to the Winter Paralympics starting later this week, where our New Zealand para-athletes will compete in the para - alpine ski events and, no doubt, will continue to make New Zealanders proud.",2/03/2022 14:01

This is a matter of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. In considering an application for an urgent debate, it is relevant whether there are other parliamentary means of debating the subject. In this instance, the member has lodged an oral question about it and could take an opportunity in the general debate to raise it. For those reasons, the application is declined.",2/03/2022 15:18

1427,ContinueSpeech,Jacinda Ardern," I move, That this House condemns the recent unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine by Russia, that it calls on Russia to cease all military operations in Ukraine and withdraw, and express New Zealand's strong support for Ukraine's people, its sovereignty and territorial integrity.",1/03/2022 14:01
1428,a,Speaker,"I will begin with the words of my colleague, foreign affairs Minister, Nanaia Mahuta. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the blatant act of a bully—brutal, intolerable, and an act of aggression that has been met with condemnation from the people and the Parliament of New Zealand. ",1/03/2022 14:01
1429,a,Speaker,"We are united. Russia's actions are a direct challenge to our core values: democracy, human rights, and the international rules-based system—values that we rely on for our own peace and security. We live in a world that is increasingly connected and borderless, a world where a challenge to one is a challenge to all. And that is why we have not only taken a strong position in condemning Russia's invasion because of our beliefs and our values but because, now more than ever, we must all take a stand together.",1/03/2022 14:01
1430,a,Speaker,"Vladimir Putin's decision to launch an unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine is a flagrant breach of international law. By choosing to pursue this entirely avoidable path, innocent lives will be lost. New Zealand and our international partners call on Russia to do what is right. We call for an immediate end to military operations in Ukraine, and a permanent withdrawal to end a pointless war.",1/03/2022 14:01
1431,a,Speaker,"The Russian Government has repeatedly ignored opportunities for diplomacy, negotiation, and de-escalation. Instead, Vladimir Putin has ordered an aggressive, unprovoked assault on the people and Government of Ukraine. This was not a miscalculation as a result of Russia's unprecedented military build-up on Ukraine's borders; this was a deliberate, calculated, and cynical decision—a decision to violate Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, a decision to breach fundamental tenets of international law, and a decision by a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council to violate the UN Charter. Russia must now face the consequences of those decisions; so must Belarus, for its accomplice role in facilitating Russia's invasion. ",1/03/2022 14:01
1432,a,Speaker,"We have moved quickly in condemning the invasion. New Zealand immediately implemented a number of measures in response to Russia's actions. These are: the introduction of targeted travel bans against Russian Government officials and other individuals associated with the invasion of Ukraine, and the prohibition of export of goods to Russian military and security forces. This covers the export of all goods intended for use by the Russian military and security forces, including any armed force, paramilitary force, police force, or militia. This includes weapons and dual-use technology that have a civilian use but are intended for military use or that may have military applications. Such a blanket ban is a significant step, as it removes the ability for exporters to apply for a permit and sends a clear signal of support to Ukraine. And, thirdly, the measures include the suspension of bilateral foreign ministry consultations until further notice.",1/03/2022 14:01
1433,a,Speaker,"I want to be very clear here, though: New Zealand has not yet reached the extent of the measures we will take to condemn this act. We are pursuing new measures to target Russian investment, including measures to target financial institutions in New Zealand, including separate but Russian-targeted, specific legislation. We continue to engage with international partners over the collective action we can all take, but it is clear that there will be a significant cost imposed on Russia for their actions. Our message must be clear: we are united. ",1/03/2022 14:01
1434,a,Speaker,"Hundreds of people have already been killed or injured, hundreds of thousands more already displaced because of a conflict it seems the Russian people did not choose. The harrowing images of displaced or suffering civilians in Ukraine speak volumes of this unfolding tragedy and underline in very stark terms the human consequences of Russia's aggression. ",1/03/2022 14:01
1435,a,Speaker,"The scale of the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding is devastating. As a first step, we have moved quickly and announced a contribution of $2 million in humanitarian aid to support those in Ukraine impacted as a result of Russia's unprovoked invasion. Our initial contribution will help deliver essential humanitarian assistance, with a focus on supporting health facilities and meeting basic needs such as provision of food and hygiene items. We will continue to contribute to humanitarian assistance, as a core part of our role in the global response. ",1/03/2022 14:01
1436,a,Speaker,"I want to finish with the words of the President of Ukraine, who, hours before Russia invaded, said the following: ""Our main goal is peace in Ukraine and the safety of our people … For that, we are ready to have talks with anybody, including you (Russia) in any format, on any platform. The war will deprive guarantees from everybody—nobody will have security guarantees anymore. Who will suffer from it the most? The people. Who doesn't want it the most? The people. Who can stop it? The people. But are there those people among you?""",1/03/2022 14:01

1444,a,Chris Hipkins,"Mr Speaker, this is an historic day for Parliament, with members participating remotely in the proceedings in the Chamber for the first time. You and the other presiding officers, I know, are going to considerable lengths to ensure that you can preserve your own health and wellbeing and that you're able to be in the Chamber when required. But after discussions at the Business Committee, I think it has been agreed that it would be wise to have an additional presiding officer on the team so that we can ensure that we have a presiding officer available for the duration of any remote sitting.",1/03/2022 15:41
1445,a,Chris Hipkins,"So I have great pleasure in nominating Ian McKelvie for the role of Assistant Speaker. He's a very experienced member of the House, having been member for Rangitīkei since 2011. He's the chairperson of the Governance and Administration Committee, a role that he performs, I'm told, with good humour and fairness. He is a respected and liked member across the House. He has a very calm and genial approach—qualities that I'm sure will serve him and us very well in the Chair. And so I thank him for agreeing to take on this role of Assistant Speaker, and commend his appointment to the House.",1/03/2022 15:41
1446,Speech,Chris Hipkins," In accordance with the determination of the Business Committee, I move, That this House approve the following orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020: COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Amendment Order (No 2) 2021, COVID-19 Public Health Response (Required Testing and Vaccinations) Amendment Order (No 2) 2021, COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Amendment Order (No 3) 2021, COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order 2021, COVID-19 Public Health Response (Isolation and Quarantine and Other Matters) Amendment Order 2021, COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border and Isolation and Quarantine) Amendment Order (No 2) 2021, COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border and Isolation and Quarantine) Amendment Order (No 2) Amendment Order 2021, COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border and Isolation and Quarantine) Amendment Order 2022, COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Amendment Order 2022, COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Amendment Order (No 2) 2022, COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations) Amendment Order 2022, and COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Amendment Order (No 3) 2022.",1/03/2022 15:46
1447,a,Chris Hipkins,"I'd like to begin by thanking the Business Committee for agreeing to debate the motion today. Here we are again, and I'm asking the House to approve a number of orders—12 orders—that have been made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act. As is the nature with these debates, some of those orders themselves are already out of date and have already been replaced by other orders, and some are about to be, based on the announcement that we made yesterday. But I would like to, as I always do in these debates, thank the Regulations Review Committee for their consideration of these various orders. I think the committee does a very thorough job on behalf of the House in scrutinising the use of the powers provided under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act, and I'll touch on a few of the themes of their comments in a few moments.",1/03/2022 15:46
1448,a,Chris Hipkins,"So the orders that we are confirming here were made between 10 December last year, 2021, and 23 January this year. The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Amendment Order (No 2) 2021 was reported back from the Regulations Review Committee in its report on 10 February. The remaining 11 were featured in the committee's report on 17 February. The 12 orders in question cover quite a wide range of issues, including the opening up of the Auckland boundary just before Christmas, the status of different parts of New Zealand in the traffic light system, and so on.",1/03/2022 15:46
1449,a,Chris Hipkins,"The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order 2021 and the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Isolation and Quarantine and Other Matters) Amendment Order 2021 set out the revised regime for travellers arriving into New Zealand that came into effect late on Monday this week and that was about to be replaced as of late tomorrow night. That, of course, was the one stepping through the removal of managed isolation and quarantine and imposing a self-solation system instead. That, of course, is now going to be replaced by another order that will also go through this process that, in due course, we will address and have to confirm here in the House.",1/03/2022 15:46
1450,a,Chris Hipkins,"Other amendments address technical drafting issues, and they seek to clarify details that have emerged as our response to COVID-19 has continued to develop. I would like to take a moment here to thank the Parliamentary Counsel Office, who work under great pressure to put these orders together, often having to do so in a very compressed time table, and often having to deal with what are quite technical issues—often quite a complex network and web of technical issues that they have to work their way through. Inevitably, from time to time, there are technical drafting amendments that need to be corrected, and we try and correct those in the next orders that are made.",1/03/2022 15:46
1451,a,Chris Hipkins,"The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework) Amendment Order (No 2) 2021 dealt with a range of issues related to the crossing of the Auckland boundary. At the time of the transition from alert levels to the protection framework, the Regulations Review Committee expressed some concerns not about the orders themselves, or the provisions of the order, but about the accessibility of regulations. And they raised similar concerns about the difficulties of navigation through the order when they expressed concerns about the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order of 2021. The committee asked for clarity over the meaning and criteria that applied to country groups in this order and, again, an issue around the ease of understanding.",1/03/2022 15:46
1452,a,Chris Hipkins,"So the constant revision and updating that the rapid development of COVID-19 has necessitated has been a challenge in terms of keeping the secondary legislation as easy possible to navigate, and I want to acknowledge that, and I thank the Regulations Review Committee for drawing attention to those issues. I do agree that it's important the regulations should be clear, they should be easily understandable, and the comments and feedback of the Regulations Review Committee will help us to continue to improve the design of orders in the future.",1/03/2022 15:46
1453,a,Chris Hipkins,"There are two orders that have been omitted from this motion, and I will cover them now because they have been subject of significant discussion over the last few days. The requests for vaccination mandates that originally came from the Police and the Defence Force were the subject of orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act. There are operational factors that drove the decision by those agencies to request the vaccination requirements: for example, Defence Force personnel need to be vaccinated in order to undertake overseas deployments, in many instances, including in places like the Pacific for disaster relief. So there are operational considerations there.",1/03/2022 15:46
1454,a,Chris Hipkins,"The decision of the courts to not uphold those two orders has only just been released, and we do need to take time to consider that. I do want to be clear that the judgment's quite clear that it's not questioning the role of mandates per se but whether they are required specifically for Police and for Defence in terms of business continuity purposes. So we need to take time to just carefully consider what the court's ruling is—not have a knee-jerk response to that. So we will do that, and then we'll make further decisions. We have been really clear, though, that where there is no longer a justification for a vaccination mandate to be in place, we would look to remove that in a timely manner. So, in some cases, in the case of the Police, very high rates of vaccination have now been achieved, and it may well be that there is no replacement for that mandate. But we'll work through a careful process to look at that, and then we'll make decisions in due course.",1/03/2022 15:46
1455,a,Chris Hipkins,"In terms of wider issues around vaccine mandates, as the Prime Minister and I have both been clear, we will seek to remove those at the appropriate time, and at the moment, as we head into what is already a very large outbreak and growing by the day, it isn't the right moment to do that in many cases, but we will consider each of those mandates on a case by case basis. When the case has been made for them to be removed, then we would look to do that.",1/03/2022 15:46
1456,Interjection,Chris Bishop, Does that mean these four—the Police ones—they're not approved?,1/03/2022 15:46
1457,ContinueSpeech,Chris Hipkins," The Defence Force one, the one that related to Defence, and the one that related to Police, which were the subject of the court decision last week, have not been included in the motion. The motion was revised and has removed those from that. They're not being confirmed, so they will lapse. I didn't want the Parliament to be in a position of, effectively, voting to confirm something that the courts have ruled against, so we've removed those from the motion, and we'll now take some time to consider what the future of those, if any future, may be. With that, Mr Speaker, I congratulate you and commend this motion to the House.",1/03/2022 15:46

1482,a,Chris Hipkins,Appendix D is modified to the extent necessary to enable the coverage of members participating remotely in a sitting.,17/02/2022 15:02
1483,a,Chris Hipkins,"This is quite a significant day for the New Zealand Parliament. New Zealand Parliament has always sat in this or a similar debating chamber for the entire time of its existence and members, up until now, have not been able to participate remotely—they've either been here or they haven't. The reality of the global pandemic is we are entering into a phase now where more people will be unable to attend the parliamentary debating chamber, either because they have COVID-19 or because they are isolating because they have been exposed to somebody—a household contact, for example—who has COVID-19. It is quite conceivable that in the next few weeks we will see some, potentially, senior members of Parliament unable to attend and participate in parliamentary proceedings unless we find an alternative way for them to do so.",17/02/2022 15:02
1484,a,Chris Hipkins,"Other Parliaments and other democracies around the world have also had to grapple with this issue. We've seen in Westminster, the home of Parliament, similar arrangements being put in place to allow people to beam in. We've seen the Australian Prime Minister participate in their version of question time via TV screen. So other Parliaments and other democracies have had to grapple with these very same issues that we are grappling with here in New Zealand.",17/02/2022 15:02
1485,a,Chris Hipkins,"It is vitally important at a time like this that our democratic institutions can continue to function. We've had a variety of different approaches to that as part of our pandemic response. We have been fortunate that for most of the last two years, our Parliament has been able to sit relatively normally, albeit with some additional public health measures like social distancing and so on. But we now are entering a phase where, with more cases in the community, we can't necessarily take that for granted.",17/02/2022 15:02
1486,a,Chris Hipkins,"So the motion that we are passing now creates an enabling framework for MPs to participate remotely in the Parliament's proceedings. There are safeguards in place, though—the decisions about when and how to initiate these provisions will be made by Parliament's Business Committee and they will be made using the usual approach of Business Committee decisions, on a near-unanimity basis. So most parties in Parliament will need to agree to members participating remotely in order for that to happen.",17/02/2022 15:02
1487,a,Chris Hipkins,"The Business Committee will also be able to determine for how long it happens and any conditions that may be imposed on people's ability to participate remotely. For example, if there was an outbreak that affected a particular area, it could be that only members from that particular area were included. There are a variety of things that the Business Committee will be able to consider. So this is not a sudden abandonment of Parliament's debating chamber. There will still be aspects of parliamentary proceedings that happen here in the Chamber. It is quite conceivable that, in fact, it is the minority of members who will be participating remotely, while the majority of members are still able to be here in the Chamber. But it is also conceivable that we could have a situation where the minority are in the Chamber and the majority are participating remotely. This allows for that eventuality. If we get to that point, but it would be Parliament's Business Committee that would make that determination.",17/02/2022 15:02
1488,a,Chris Hipkins,"As I've said before, we would need to get cross-party and cross-Parliament support for any remote sitting to take place. I think that that is important. We will need to feel our way here a little bit. No doubt there will be some teething troubles along the way. There might be the odd frozen Zoom call as we've all been used to. I look forward to the first member trying to participate in proceedings with their mute button on—it's only a matter of time before that happens. But I'm sure that we will be able to make this work and I think it is important that we do make this work.",17/02/2022 15:02
1489,a,Chris Hipkins,"In making these decisions—and it's been a long journey, a lot of a lot of debate has gone into these rules—we have been mindful of the fact that members of Parliament are very active travellers. We are very active in the community and, therefore, we are at more risk of coming into contact with COVID-19. I think the last thing that New Zealanders want to see is that potentially quite significant parts of parliamentary procedure are unable to go ahead because people can't participate. So this allows our Parliament to continue to function in a global pandemic and allows all members of Parliament to still be able to participate. I think that that's very, very important.",17/02/2022 15:02
1490,a,Chris Hipkins,"Finally—and this is something that I also raised with the parliamentary Business Committee—I arrived in the New Zealand Parliament at a time when attendance at the House was paramount above all else. I can recall instances where party whips would require people who were quite unwell to come into the parliamentary complex, sometimes to sleep on the couch in their office, in order to make up the numbers. I hope that we are reaching an era where we can be a little bit more sensible about some of those things. Sometimes the best thing for people to do when they are unwell—most of the time, in fact—is for them to stay home and get better rather than exposing others to whatever ailment it is that they have. I think that doesn't apply just to Parliament; it actually applies right the way across our society. I think a global pandemic has certainly prompted many, many people to rethink their attitudes when it comes to ""soldiering on"" when they are unwell.",17/02/2022 15:02
1491,a,Chris Hipkins,"I think that this latest change that we are making in the Parliament should be a welcome one. It is one that I think we will all take care about using, it is one that responds to a global pandemic, it is in keeping with what's happening internationally, and so I commend this particular resolution to the House.",17/02/2022 15:02

1495,a,Carmel Sepuloni (Minister For Social Development And Employment) On Behalf Of The Minister For Covid-19 Response,"Once more we are asking the House to approve COVID-19 orders to ensure that they are not revoked within certain time frames. The House has considered a series of these motions over the past two years or so. The collection of orders before us today is perhaps the most significant so far. It demonstrates the necessity of a system that enables us to respond to the rapid pace of change that is characteristic of COVID-19 but that ensures that parliamentary debate and approval remains an essential part of the process. There are 10 orders in the motion before us today. The presentation of My Vaccine Passes has quickly become part of everyday life for the overwhelming majority of New Zealanders—to be shown to be able to enter certain areas, places, or premises, or to receive some services. The system was established by the COVID-19 Public Health Response (COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate) Order 2021 and its subsequent amendment, both of which are in today's motion. They are a critical component of New Zealand's world-leading COVID 19 response.",16/02/2022 17:53
1496,Intervention,Chris Bishop," Point of order, Madam Speaker. We're in a slightly unusual situation here where we don't have the actual Minister for COVID-19 Response, or indeed the Associate Minister, moving the motion and I think I'm right in saying that the Minister who is presumably acting on behalf of the Minister didn't actually move the motion on behalf of the Minister for COVID-19 Response—",16/02/2022 17:53

1504,Intervention,Assistant Speaker," That is fair to say. I would like to call the Hon Carmel Sepuloni to continue with the speech and may I suggest, Chris Bishop, that if you are to listen carefully, you would have actually heard that she moved the motion.",16/02/2022 17:53
1505,ContinueSpeech,Carmel Sepuloni, For the benefit of the members in the House—and I do hope that they are listening now—I thank the members of the Regulations Review Committee for their work in examining these orders.

1514,Speech,Speaker," I regret to inform the House of the death on 9 February 2022 of the Hon Peter Neilson, who represented the electorate of Miramar between 1981 and 1990. During his membership of this House, he held a number of ministerial positions including Minister of Works and Development, Minister of Customs, Minister of Revenue, and Associate Minister of State-owned Enterprises. I desire, on the House, to express our sense of the loss that we have sustained and our sympathy with the relatives of the late former member. I now ask members to stand with me and observe a period of silence as a mark of respect to his memory.",15/02/2022 14:00
1515,Speech,Speaker," I have received a letter from Brooke van Velden seeking to debate under Standing Order 399 my response to the protests at Parliament. An urgent debate may only be held if the matter involves the ministerial or administrative responsibility of the Government—Standing Order 399(2)(b). The Speaker is not a member of the Government, and the actions of the Speaker cannot be the subject of an urgent debate. For members who want to look closely at this matter, Speaker Carter gave an extensive ruling on the point, on 6 December 2016. I refer the member to that ruling and to Speakers' ruling 201/6, which states that an urgent debate ""is not [the] vehicle for addressing matters that are the responsibility of the Speaker"". The application is declined.",15/02/2022 14:59

1517,a,Jacinda Ardern,"On 6 February 1952, aged just 25, Queen Elizabeth II ascended to the Throne and became the monarch of seven independent States, including New Zealand. Now, 70 years later, she's Queen of the 15 Commonwealth Realms, some of which did not exist as independent nations at the time. This change in the world's geopolitical make-up is a strong reminder of the tremendous changes that have taken place in the world in the last 70 years, and through all of those years the Queen has stood as a model of service and unwavering dedication to her role. ",9/02/2022 14:01
1518,a,Jacinda Ardern,"As Queen of New Zealand, the Queen has always taken a strong personal interest in our nation. She has visited here 10 times between 1953 and 2002. She's also attended many events in the United Kingdom celebrating and commemorating New Zealand and the wider Commonwealth. I have had the honour to meet her both in person and virtually, and I know that she has a deep knowledge of Aotearoa New Zealand and cares sincerely for the wellbeing of our nation. In more recent times when travel has been limited, the Queen has reached out to us here in New Zealand on at least two occasions in the midst of the pandemic. Her motivation was no more than to ask how everyone in New Zealand was doing. Her care and clear affection for Aotearoa and its people has been obvious in every conversation I've had the pleasure of having with her.",9/02/2022 14:01
1519,a,Jacinda Ardern,"A few weeks ago in her Christmas message, the Queen said that she hoped that her platinum jubilee year would be an opportunity for people everywhere to enjoy a sense of togetherness. There are different views in society, and, indeed, in this Parliament on the role of the monarchy. However, I know that we all join with Her Majesty's wish for a shared sense of togetherness as we face the challenges of the future.",9/02/2022 14:01

1522,Speech,Chairperson," Before I report progress on the bill, I need to correct a vote on clause 1 of the Conversion Practices Prohibition Legislation Bill. So the correct vote is: the Ayes are 113 and the Noes are seven. The Ayes have it. I will now report progress on the previous bills.",9/02/2022 21:54
1523,Speech,Speaker," The House is resumed. Members, following discussions at the Business Committee today, I want to inform you about how the House will handle voting over the Conversion Practices Prohibition Legislation Bill. The National Party has indicated that it intends to treat all future votes on the bill as a conscience issue. No other party has indicated that it is doing so, and, in fact, it was treated as a party vote matter at the first reading. Normally, I would allow a personal vote in such circumstances. However, we need to consider how to maintain physical distancing in the debating chamber and lobbies and personal voting makes that challenging. ",8/02/2022 19:00
1524,a,Speaker,"At the Business Committee, we agreed to use split party voting—as set out in Standing Order 145—on the Conversion Practices Prohibition Legislation Bill. Split party voting, effectively, allows members to vote individually but their votes are aggregated by their parties and cast during the party voting process. Parties splitting their votes indicate to the Clerk, when called on, how many votes they wish to cast for or against the question and any abstentions. They then provide the Clerk with a list showing how the vote of each member of the party was cast. These votes are recorded in the Journals of the House and in the Hansard.",8/02/2022 19:00
1525,a,Speaker,"When we get to the committee of the whole House stage, there will be multiple votes because the bill is in three Parts and there may be amendments proposed. Casting split party votes on amendments is more challenging logistically. I would encourage any member planning amendments to release them as a Supplementary Order Paper as soon as possible so others can consider their positions. ",8/02/2022 19:00
1526,a,Speaker,"If a member is not sure how they will vote until they have heard the debate or wishes to react to amendments as they are presented, I encourage them to be in the Chamber for the debate subject to the limits on numbers. They can then instruct their whip how they wish to cast their vote. Standing Order 145 also enables members to cast their votes as individuals, separately from their parties, if they so wish. That might be useful in the more dynamic committee stage of the whole House environment. Such votes are cast by a member rising in their place and indicating how they wish to vote when the Clerk calls for any other votes. Clearly, before members do that, they have to indicate to their party whip that they do not want to be included within the other numbers.",8/02/2022 19:00
1527,a,Speaker,The House seldom uses split party votes. Presiding officers will proceed more slowly than usual with votes to ensure that parties are ready to cast them. So members will have to give a little bit of patience to the whips in order to get their ducks in a row so that we get the system working well.,8/02/2022 19:00
1528,Speech,Speaker," Members, before I call Government order of the day No. 2, I will ask members, and especially whips, to consult their emails before they leave the buildings tonight.",8/02/2022 21:00
1529,Speech,Chris Hipkins," I move, That this House approve the following orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020: ",15/12/2021 15:02
1530,a,Chris Hipkins,"This is the last one for 2020. There have been several such motions in the House this year to confirm orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act. I do want to begin this particular contribution with a very genuine word of thanks to the members of the Regulations Review Committee, who have done a very thorough job of scrutinising every one of the orders that's been made under that Act. They provided some incredibly constructive feedback and suggestions for how those orders can be improved, some of which have resulted in revisions to the orders, and some actually resulted in some changes to the primary legislation under which those orders are made. I do want to thank the committee for the way that it has engaged with that.",15/12/2021 15:02
1531,a,Chris Hipkins,"Just to very quickly—I'm not going to run through all of the orders that are covered by this particular confirmation, but they do cover a lot of things, from required vaccinations through to changes to the air border order, which makes it a requirement to be fully vaccinated to come into New Zealand if you are not a citizen. There are changes that are being made to the required testing and the frequency of testing that people need to undertake. Changes have been made to the quarantine-free travel arrangements with our Pacific neighbours, particularly with the Cook Islands, Niue, Samoa, Tokelau, Tonga, and Vanuatu.",15/12/2021 15:02
1532,a,Chris Hipkins,"There have been changes made to the maritime border order in terms of defining the amount of time that people need to isolate on board ships before being able to come abroad. There are some changes to the required time frames for vaccination, particularly around Fire and Emergency New Zealand. That covers the main thrust of the changes. The rest deal with relatively, I think, technical issues around the required vaccination requirements.",15/12/2021 15:02
1533,a,Chris Hipkins,"I do acknowledge, as I always have done in issuing these orders, that it's an enormous responsibility that I have as the Minister who has to sign them. I think this is a very important part of the process where Parliament confirms those orders, because they are made in a relatively unusual way, in the sense that they are scrutinised after they have been made, rather than before, unlike most primary legislation, where it gets thoroughly scrutinised before it is made. So I want to thank members of the House for the way they have approached these orders throughout the course of the year. This is the last one for this year, although I have to tell members that there'll be another confirmation motion on either the first or the second day back after the summer holidays for them to look forward to.",15/12/2021 15:02
1534,a,Chris Hipkins,"But finally, can I just take a moment to thank all those who were involved in both putting the orders together and implementing the orders. The Parliamentary Counsel Office often have to turn these orders around overnight, where something's happened urgently, and we need to put the orders in place. I acknowledge the huge pressure they have been under this year, as a result, largely, of COVID-19 - related demands, among other things. But I really want to thank them and put on record my thanks to them for the way that they have handled this. I also want to thank those at the front line who have to implement these orders, again, often at quite short notice, and thank them for their work, their commitment to our COVID-19 strategy, and wish everybody involved a very merry Christmas.",15/12/2021 15:02
1535,Speech,Speaker," Members, before we proceed, I just want to inform members that for question time we will be without our normal te reo interpretation service as a result of the weather at Wellington Airport and losing both of our interpreters that way. We are hopeful, though, that by the end of question time we'll have a remote service available and that way people who are listening from outside will be able to have the interpretation. I will now ask for members who do speak in te reo, if they wish to, to do an interpretation. I did offer to one of the parties that if they didn't like that approach I'd get Mr Jackson to interpret, but he doesn't appear to be available.",14/12/2021 14:00

1544,ContinueSpeech,Chairperson," —seriously?—for further consideration of current issues and priorities—I've got a lot to say—in a special debate. There are 46 minutes and 12 seconds remaining in the debate. This a timed debate, and the clock keeps ticking during any points of order or when Ministers swap in or out. The remaining time available for Labour is only 15 minutes and 57 seconds remaining. The remaining time available for each other party is as follows: New Zealand National, 51 minutes and 38 seconds; Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, nil; ACT New Zealand, three minutes and 27 seconds; and Te Paati Māori, six minutes and 12 seconds. The question is that current issues and priorities be noted. ",14/12/2021 20:01

1546,a,Chris Hipkins,"The COVID-19 Public Health Response Act was passed in the early stages of the global pandemic. It is the law that gives the Government of the day the ability to issue orders around things like vaccination, around testing, around quarantine at the border, around pre-departure testing, and around all of those other things that might be required to manage the ongoing effects of a global pandemic. Because of the sweeping nature of the powers contained within that legislation, additional safeguards were built into it. One is that the law itself expires. It has a sunset provision, which means that the Government will have to determine—and that sunset provision's currently set for, I think, mid-2023. The Government would either have to come back to the House with another bill to renew that legislation, or it will disappear. It also has a requirement for periodic renewal by the House. That means that, roughly, every six months the Government has to present to the House a motion like the one we are presenting now, which allows for the Act to be continued. So we are currently proposing that the Act be continued until the middle of next year, by which point we will either have to pass another motion to continue to extend it or again it will expire. ",9/12/2021 9:00
1547,a,Chris Hipkins,"The global pandemic has created huge disruption around the world and here in New Zealand. I think there are many people, myself included, who look forward to the day when the global pandemic is over and life can get back to normal and we can all get back to doing the things that we all love and enjoy. The reality is that the global pandemic is not yet over and we don't know when it will be over. There is still significant uncertainty, and particularly uncertainty around the potential for new variants. ",9/12/2021 9:00
1548,a,Chris Hipkins,"Omicron has appeared, and we still have yet to fully understand it. We do know that it's likely to be more infectious. More people are likely to get it. Anecdotally, we're seeing evidence that more fully vaccinated people will also get it. What we don't yet know, though, is what the effect of that will be. Is it more viral than earlier variants? Does it have a greater health impact or does it potentially have less of a health impact? That is still a big, unknown question, and we'll learn more about Omicron over the coming weeks and months. So we need to be ready to adapt and evolve, depending on what that new information, what that new research, and what that new evidence tells us. ",9/12/2021 9:00
1549,a,Chris Hipkins,"In the meantime, New Zealand is incredibly well placed. So we have very low rates of transmission in the community. We have a very high rate of vaccination. We have good surveillance testing, and it's encouraging to see that our surveillance testing rates are remaining very high, and so we are well positioned. Next year, we do want to be able to, early in the year, open up the international border and see much greater movement in and out of New Zealand again, and we've set out a pathway to do that.

1550,a,Chris Hipkins,"Many of the things that we are doing now still require this legislation to be in place. For example, the requirement, at the most basic level, for people to be either vaccinated or to get a pre-departure test—so for New Zealand citizens, they will need a pre-departure test before they come home to New Zealand; for non-citizens, they will need to be fully vaccinated. Just that requirement alone depends on this Act continuing to be in existence. The traffic light framework, which New Zealanders are all now becoming familiar with, requires this legislation to be in place. The vaccination requirements that exist for our front-line border workers and for many of those other workforces require this legislation to be in place. So we are not yet through the global pandemic and, therefore, the need for the powers that are in this legislation to remain in place still exist. ",9/12/2021 9:00
1551,a,Chris Hipkins,"I do want to say, as I've said on many occasions in the House, that I acknowledge that these are extraordinary times and that this is an extraordinary piece of legislation. It is one that in an open and liberal democracy, we should aim to have on the statute book only as long as it is absolutely essential to have it. This should not be seen as the beginning of a different way of doing things for New Zealand and is certainly not the way the Government views it. We view this as being a necessity at this point, but it should only be available to the Government for as long as it is an absolute necessity. As soon as more regular decision-making processes can resume, we should absolutely be doing that. ",9/12/2021 9:00
1552,a,Chris Hipkins,"So I have a mixed degree of emotion in moving this motion in the House today, because as the person who has the weight of the responsibility of making orders under this legislation sitting on my shoulders, I am very much looking forward to the day when that will no longer be the case. Unfortunately, that is not today. So that is the reason why the Government is proposing to extend the life of this Act. ",9/12/2021 9:00

1574,Speech,Chris Hipkins," Sorry, Mr Speaker—that's me, Mr Speaker, and I apologise. I'll just find the appropriate piece of paper. I seek leave to move a motion regarding a change to Parliament's sessional orders in how it deals with COVID19 orders. ",25/11/2021 14:46
1575,Intervention,Speaker, Is there any objection to course of action being followed? There is none.,25/11/2021 14:46
1576,ContinueSpeech,Chris Hipkins," I move, That the House amend the rules relating to the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020, adopted by the House as a sessional order on 8 December 2020, by replacing the definition of COVID-19 order in rule 1 (Interpretation) with: ""COVID-19 order has the meaning given to it by section 5(1) of the Act.""",25/11/2021 14:46
1577,a,Chris Hipkins,"The purpose of this is very clear. Yesterday, Parliament amended the COVID-19 Response Act. The current sessional orders deal with the COVID-19 response orders made under the Act as it existed prior to yesterday. We need to amend the sessional orders that we have put in place to ensure that the new order-making provisions inserted by the Act yesterday are now covered by those sessional orders. So this will ensure that those orders, particularly related to vaccination requirements, are subject to the same process. Under that process, they're tabled in the House. They are then referred to the Regulations Review Committee. The Regulations Review Committee scrutinise those. They report them back to the House, and the House then confirms them by way of a motion in the House. ",25/11/2021 14:46
1578,a,Chris Hipkins,"So it's a minor technical amendment to ensure that the rules of the Parliament keep pace with the changing nature of the legislation, but I think that that scrutiny function has served the Parliament very, very well. I think that the Regulations Review Committee have done a very thorough job of scrutinising the orders that have been made under that Act and have often prompted changes to some of the orders that have been made under that Act for the better, and certainly have prompted changes sometimes in the process of the way some of those orders have been made as well, which, again, I think has been useful. I think the debates that we have had in the House around confirming those orders has also been important for the purposes of transparency and accountability. So making sure that those existing provisions apply to the new order-making powers, I think, is very important, and hence that's why I've moved the motion.",25/11/2021 14:46

1581,a,Speaker,"Urgency of this type used to be common. It isn't any more, for good reason; it resulted in bad law. Taking a bill one stage per day and using even a truncated select committee process improves the understanding of legislators, allows for informed public and specialist comment, and, generally, improves the quality of the legislation.",24/11/2021 12:50
1582,a,Speaker,"This policy first became public on 15 October. The policy decisions, the drafting instructions, or an exposure draft of the bill could and should have been made public and preferably considered by a select committee, either through reference through the House or using committees' inquiry functions. The failure for that to occur is primarily the Government's responsibility. But I do note that I have enquired of the Health Committee, the Governance and Administration Committee, and the Finance and Expenditure Committee, and no member of the House requested any use of the inquiry functions at any of those committees, and, therefore, it is a matter which has widespread responsibility.",24/11/2021 12:50

1584,Speech,Dr Elizabeth Kerekere, Kia ora.

1585,Speech,Assistant Speaker, Leave is sought for that purpose. Is there any objection? There is objection.,24/11/2021 16:07
1586,Speech,Michael Woodhouse," Point of order. I raise a matter of order that has some implications for the business of the House this afternoon, and it relates to an exchange and decision that was made by the committee of the whole House in the COVID-19 response bill that was being debated. During voting on Part 1 of that bill, a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) in the name of Melissa Lee was called on the voices for the Ayes. The result was not challenged, and the chair of the committee moved on to consider the next SOP. What followed was a challenge to that ruling, which led the chair to then declare the result of Melissa Lee's SOP for the Noes, and a party vote was called for.",18/11/2021 14:02
1587,a,Michael Woodhouse,"Now, my submission to you, Mr Speaker, is that that was an invalid process and outside of Standing Orders, particularly Standing Order 141, which says, ""The Speaker asks members to answer 'Aye' or 'No' to the question and states the result of the voice vote. Any member present may then call for a further vote to be held."" That did not happen. Furthermore, in Speakers' rulings we have a requirement, at Speaker's ruling 66/2, that ""When the Speaker declares the result on the voices, that, unless challenged, is final and may not be disputed."" Speaker's ruling 67/1 states that ""If members want a party vote, they must challenge the Speaker at the time when the result is declared. A party vote does not follow automatically because a voice is given for the Noes."" In the case that we're discussing, I'm sure it would equally apply if the voice was for the Ayes.",18/11/2021 14:02
1588,a,Michael Woodhouse,This is important because my submission to you is that a vote validly cast means that Ms Lee's SOP stands part of the bill that we will be debating after question time in its third reading. I seek your considered ruling upholding Standing Order 141 and the Speakers' rulings 66/2 and 67/1.,18/11/2021 14:02

During his membership of this House, he held a number of ministerial positions, including Minister of Commerce, Minister of Māori Affairs, Minister of Police, and Minister of Industry.

Minister Sepuloni is in the chair on more than one portfolio from 5 p.m. So that the correct official is in the Chamber to support the Minister, we will focus first on matters relating to the social development and disability issues portfolios.

1595,Speech,Angie Warren-Clark," That's not an insult, Madam Chair. I'm delighted to stand as the chair of the Social Services and Community Committee, and lead off this debate on the Estimates for Vote Special Development 2021/22. This report was tabled in July 2021 and it has been a while since the Minister was able to address this Chamber, and we welcome her back here. I acknowledge the Ministers and ministries for their work during a difficult time under Delta COVID conditions. ",17/11/2021 17:02
1596,a,Angie Warren-Clark,"Vote Social Development is the largest vote in the Budget, with $36.1 billion allocated, which is a 4.7 percent increase from the year 2020-21. Benefits or related expenses account for 85 percent or $30.8 billion of Vote Social Development, with New Zealand super at $17.7 billion being the largest spend per annum. Vote Social Development is the responsibility of eight ministerial portfolios. We heard that Budget 2021 proposes to increase main benefits on 1 July 2021 and 1 April 2022. In total we heard main rates would be increased by $32 to $55 per adult per week. We heard that families with children, individuals, couples, and students will receive rises. We heard that childcare assistance will increase for low to middle income families. The orphans benefit and the unsupported child benefit will also increase. We heard that thousands of children will be lifted out of poverty due to these increases.",17/11/2021 17:02
1597,a,Angie Warren-Clark,"We asked why benefits would be increased and were told by the Minister that this would have the twin outcomes of lifting the lowest incomes and increasing economic stimulus. We learnt that the Government had been advised that by early 2021, 490,000 people could have been receiving a benefit, an increase of 100,000 people. This predicted peak was not reached and we discussed actual numbers of people on benefits, including those who work part time, or cannot look for work, or are caring for someone with a condition or disability.",17/11/2021 17:02
1598,a,Angie Warren-Clark,"We asked about people on the job seeker benefit for longer than three years and which initiatives were most effective for moving them off benefit. We learnt that $1.24 billion is allocated to the multi-category appropriation, improved employment and social outcomes support. This is an increase. We heard that the Flexiwage eligibility was expanded. Estimates hearings also covered support for children with disabilities, payment cards for young parents, debt write-downs, changes to monitoring of Oranga Tamariki, helping people to access and retain housing, and emergency housing. We also heard about the reinstatement of the training incentive allowance for all courses up to level 7 and the doubling of the winter energy payment for beneficiaries, including superannuitants.",17/11/2021 17:02
1599,a,Angie Warren-Clark,"We discussed the disability sector and the Minister brought in sign language interpreters to make this hearing more accessible. We've continued this practice where we can. The appropriation promoting positive outcomes for disabled people is $8.6 million, including funding for the Office for Disability Issues, which monitors and implements the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by monitoring and promoting the implementation of the New Zealand Disability Strategy, 2016 to 2026, and the Disability Action Plan 2019 to 2023. We've heard that one in four New Zealanders are disabled. We heard that the Enabling Good Lives pilot under Vote Health will continue in three communities. This project encourages system transformation so that disabled people can determine how they use funding to best live their lives.",17/11/2021 17:02
1600,a,Angie Warren-Clark,"The Minister discussed her plans for the sector, the role of growing disability and accessible leadership, and the advice for disabled people in the governance context. Finally, we discussed helping disabled people who do paid work. As the chair of the select committee I sincerely thank the Minister, officials, the clerks, and the select committee members for a thorough and robust set of hearings. Thank you.",17/11/2021 17:02

1602,Speech,Chris Hipkins," I move, That pursuant to section 38(1) of the Public Audit Act 2014, the House appoint PKF Goldsmith Fox Audit as the independent auditor to audit the financial statements, accounts, and other information of the Office of the Controller and Auditor-General for the financial years ending 30 June 2020, 30 June 2023, and 30 June 2024. ",16/11/2021 14:53
1603,a,Chris Hipkins,"There was a brief discussion about this at the Business Committee. Of course, while I'm the person bringing the recommendation to the House, this is the recommendation of the Officers of Parliament Committee. There are only a limited number of auditors who could possibly do this work. Most significant audit firms do work contracted by the Office of the Auditor-General and therefore it would be a conflict of interest for them to themselves be auditing the Office of the Auditor-General. When previous processes have attempted to run a tender for this work to take place, it has by and large been relatively unsuccessful. In this case, the incumbent auditors, the current auditors, PKF Goldsmith Fox Audit, are happy to continue in that role, and that is the recommendation of the Officers of Parliament.",16/11/2021 14:53
1604,Speech,Chris Hipkins," I move, That this House approve the following orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020:",16/11/2021 14:55
1605,a,Chris Hipkins,"This is certainly not the first time the House has had to do this. Under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020, orders that the Government makes—or that I make as the Minister for COVID-19 Response—under the aforementioned Act, have to be endorsed by the Parliament. They only apply for 90 days if not endorsed by Parliament. In between me making an order and it coming to the floor of the House for a vote, it's scrutinised by the Regulations Review Committee. And I can tell you, as the person who receives the correspondence from the Regulations Review Committee, that they do a very thorough and diligent job of scrutinising those orders, of ensuring that they are being made consistent with the Act, of ensuring that they are not being done in a way that unduly tramples on people's rights and freedoms—although there is recognition in the Act itself that people's rights and freedoms may be affected by the COVID-19 response.",16/11/2021 14:55
1606,a,Chris Hipkins,"So I want to run through, briefly, the orders—and there are 12 orders that are under consideration today. I'll deal with them in groups.",16/11/2021 14:55
1607,a,Chris Hipkins,"Eight of the orders in question deal with alert level - type changes. So the purpose of the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order (No 12) was to prevent and limit the risk of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 by setting the level 3 conditions that are in place in Auckland, and the level 2 conditions in place around the rest of the country. Subsequent amendments have been made to that as the response has continued. The changes covered by those amendments include things like: the level 3 boundary that was put into effect in the Waikato; the level 3 period that Northland was placed at that alert level; the mandatory testing requirement for those crossing the border for work; amendments in relation to gatherings and physical distancing requirements in certain circumstances, like early childhood education; and the requirements for movement between Auckland, Waikato, and other parts of the country. I want to acknowledge that the Regulations Review Committee did make some useful comments around how we define the boundaries in the Northland region. And it recommended that the boundaries should be described by reference to roads, rivers, or other geographical markers—which the public would be more familiar with—rather than the cartographical references that are used in the current orders. I think that that is a reasonable suggestion.",16/11/2021 14:55
1608,a,Chris Hipkins,"The committee also expressed concern about amendment order No. 7 which imposed a new prohibition on people travelling to a secondary home or place of residence after a Government announcement of alert level change, and before those changes came into force. The committee was concerned that there was insufficient communication of the new rules, and if there was insufficient communication of the rules, it could lead to people unknowingly committing a criminal offence. I want to be clear here that that's always the case when an alert level changes and a boundary is put in place. This particular change was to effectively stop the Coromandel exodus that has happened once or twice from Auckland when the alert level has escalated there. People knowingly, knowing that Auckland is about to go into a lockdown, abandoned Auckland and headed out to the Coromandel to their beach houses—that somewhat defeats the purpose of having a boundary in place in order to contain the risk. So while I acknowledge the committee's concern in this particular case, I don't necessarily agree with it.",16/11/2021 14:55
1609,a,Chris Hipkins,"Two of the orders amend the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Isolation and Quarantine) Order that was put in place last year. That's the order that establishes managed isolation and quarantine. Amendment Order (No 2) updated the definition of medical examination and testing to include the use of saliva testing. Amendment Order (No 3) prescribed the requirements for self-isolation by those taking part in the Government's self-isolation project. There was one concern expressed by the Regulations Review Committee, which said that the order ""assumes a link between a person's participation in the programme and their employer."", which would not necessarily be the case, but the rationale for creating a legal obligation on the employer for the behaviour of the participant is to ensure that the employer only puts forward employees who the employer trusts to participate in that pilot programme.",16/11/2021 14:55
1610,a,Chris Hipkins,"The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations) Amendment Order (No 2) updated the principal order to extend the meaning of ""vaccinated"", to recognise some of the people who may have been vaccinated with vaccines other than Pfizer abroad. So it includes vaccines like Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, etc. The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Required Testing) Order 2020 was designed to protect and limit the risk of an outbreak by requiring testing and medical examination of affected people for COVID-19, and it put in place—for staff at various education locations and facilities—the requirement to provide a negative test before they physically enter the site. It puts in place a weekly testing requirement for unvaccinated workers at an affected education service until mandatory vaccination requirements come into force on 1 January. The committee raised some concerns about the clarity of that order, as they often do about orders, and we'll have a look at those as a package—though these orders have been pretty central to our COVID-19 response, and they've helped to play a very significant role in limiting the spread of COVID-19 cases across New Zealand. Often, they are put in place in a hurry. Often, the Regulations Review Committee—and in fact the work that officials do after orders are put in place—identify further changes, refinements, clarifications that can be put in place. That's one of the reasons why these are often regularly amended.",16/11/2021 14:55
1611,a,Chris Hipkins,"Some weeks I seem to be up until midnight most nights awaiting the day's order coming through so that it can be signed and gazetted that night, because, inevitably, given the pressure that the drafters work under here, there will be points of clarification that need to be made, and I want to thank those who do that. I do really just want to underscore that point: that when decisions are made, the process of putting the legal instruments for those in place is a very compressed one. The people who do this work do so under enormous pressure and often right into the night and into the early morning in order to make sure that the law is clear and that it can be complied with, and I certainly thank them for their efforts. They have been integral to our COVID-19 response, they have been diligent and conscientious, and they deserve our acknowledgment and our thanks.",16/11/2021 14:55

1622,Speech,Jacinda Ardern," I move, That the House express its sympathy and condolences to the family of Dame Catherine Tizard, and pay tribute to the outstanding contribution she made to this country.",9/11/2021 14:04
1623,a,Jacinda Ardern,"The Hon Dame Catherine Tizard, known to all as Dame Cath, died in Auckland on 31 October, at the age of 90. It was with great sadness that I heard of Dame Cath's death. She was a wonderful role model of leadership and determination, combined with a down-to-earth approach and an irrepressible sense of humour. ",9/11/2021 14:04
1624,a,Jacinda Ardern,"In 1971, Dame Cath was working as a senior tutor in zoology at Auckland University, while raising four children. At a time when it was still far from common for women to combine a career with running a family, let alone enter political life as well, Dame Cath took her first step into public life by standing in the Auckland City Council election. She was duly elected and remained a city councillor for 12 years while continuing to work for the university. Many will also remember her as a regular panel member on the hugely popular TV show Beauty and the Beast, from 1976 to 1985. ",9/11/2021 14:04
1625,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Dame Cath was elected Mayor of Auckland in 1983, the first woman to hold that position. The following year, she received the first of her four damehoods. Dame Cath remained mayor until 1990, during which she led two challenging and significant projects for Auckland: the development of Aotea Centre and securing the hosting of the Commonwealth Games in 1990. ",9/11/2021 14:04
1626,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Dame Cath had only just been re-elected for her third term as Mayor of Auckland when she was offered the role of Governor-General. She was only the third woman in the Commonwealth to be appointed Governor-General, of course the first in New Zealand. It was particularly significant that she was in the role when New Zealand commemorated the centenary of women's suffrage in 1993.",9/11/2021 14:04
1627,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Dame Cath was a popular Governor-General and strived to make both the role of Governor-General and Government House more accessible to New Zealanders. She instituted the first open day, allowing public access to the house and grounds. She gently dismantled some of the pomp that surrounded her role, such as discouraging curtseying and bowing to the Governor-General. She carried out her formal and ceremonial duties with serious and considered attention, and her community duties with a sense of fun and a genuine wish to engage with a diverse range of New Zealanders.",9/11/2021 14:04
1628,a,Jacinda Ardern,"For those of us privileged enough to have known Dame Cath, or to at least have had encounters with her, they were memorable. She was wise, witty, and generous. She was a role model when the world and women needed one. She's one of the people that normalised women in leadership in Aotearoa and we owe her much for that.",9/11/2021 14:04
1629,a,Jacinda Ardern,"The thoughts of the Government are with Dame Cath's family. They sacrificed much on behalf of all of us and we thank them. It is usual, of course, in New Zealand for the service of a former Governor-General to be honoured with a State funeral. At Dame Cath's request, she will have a private funeral, and we will publicly celebrate her life with a different event that will reflect her personal wishes and those of her family.",9/11/2021 14:04
1630,a,Jacinda Ardern,"We, of course, will announce details of that at the appropriate time. Until then, I know this House's thoughts are with Dame Cath's family. Rest in peace.",9/11/2021 14:04
1631,Speech,Speaker, The question is that the motion be agreed to.,9/11/2021 14:07
1632,Speech,Speaker," Now, I've got a ruling to make, but before I make the ruling I was going to make, I want to indicate to members that it's long been the rulings of Speakers in this House that political logos are not used as part of this House. I just want to indicate to people that the masks that they wear—and there have been some that have been on and off at different times—should not have political logos on it, and I've lost the member who was wearing one previously that I only noticed later. So can people take care that their masks do not include political logos. ",9/11/2021 15:11
1633,Speech,Speaker, I have received a letter from the Hon Judith Collins seeking to debate under Standing Order 399 the Government's handling of public relations in relation to the purchase of the COVID-19 vaccine. This is not a particular case of recent occurrence. The application is therefore declined. I declare members' attentions to Speakers' rulings 204/3 and 199/5.,9/11/2021 15:11
1634,Speech,Chris Bishop," Point of order. Sorry, Madam Speaker. It's come to my attention that the way the National Party voted on—I know this is slightly unusual. But the way the National Party voted in relation to Supplementary Order Papers (SOPs) from the COVID-19 management measures bill, there was a bit of confusion about two SOPs from the Green Party. Essentially, what I'm seeking leave of the House to do is to change our vote in relation to the two SOPs and flip from one to the other.",28/10/2021 12:40
1635,Speech,Assistant Speaker, Leave is sought for that course of action. Is there any objection? There is none.,28/10/2021 12:40
1636,Speech,Chris Bishop," OK. So in relation to SOP 70, which is the Hon Julie Anne Genter's SOP, National voted in favour of it and we want to vote against it, and in relation to SOP 69, which is the SOP in the name of Golriz Ghahraman, National voted against but we wish to vote in favour of it.",28/10/2021 12:41
1637,Speech,Assistant Speaker, Leave is sought for that course of action. Is there any objection? There is none.,28/10/2021 12:41
1638,Speech,Assistant Speaker," Members, before we move on, we have a correction to a vote taken during the committee stage of the COVID-19 Response (Management Measures) Legislation Bill. The vote on Chris Penk's tabled amendment inserting new Schedule 1A was wrongly announced as Ayes 43, Noes 75. The correct result is Ayes 53, Noes 65. The record will be corrected accordingly.",28/10/2021 12:48
1639,Speech,Speaker, I have received a letter from Jan Logie seeking to debate under Standing Order 399 the privacy protections of ACC in light of revelations that ACC staff have shared clients' details in a private social media group. A proposal to discuss a continuing problem or an accumulation of information is not one contemplated by Standing Order 399 in that it is not a particular case of recent occurrence—Speakers' rulings 204/4-5 refer. The privacy protections of ACC appear to me to fall into this category in that they are an ongoing matter. ,27/10/2021 14:56
1640,a,Speaker,"An urgent debate is a means by which the actions of a Government are examined. To date, the Government has not made any announcements in relation to the matter raised in the application—Speakers' ruling 205/5 refers. The only action announced to date has been the ACC standing down 12 staff and beginning an investigation. It would not be appropriate to debate a staffing matter, which is a responsibility of the chief executive, in this House. The application is, therefore, declined. ",27/10/2021 14:56
1641,a,Speaker,"Should the Government announce some further action in relation to the matter, I would consider a further application from the member. ",27/10/2021 14:56
1642,Speech,David Seymour," Point of order, Mr Speaker. I seek your assistance in interpreting a Speaker's ruling 17/7. I know you may not be used to being asked for sartorial advice, but are Air Jordans an example of business attire?",21/10/2021 14:55
1643,Speech,Speaker," Well, I'd tend to say it would depend on the business you were in. The business which Air Jordans are normally associated with, in my interpretation, is not quite the business that we expect to take part in these precincts. I am, however, taking a lot of care around further interpretation of sartorial elegance and business attire in the House. I think it is a case of twice burnt, I'm not going to do it again.",21/10/2021 14:55
1644,Speech,Rawiri Waititi," Point of order, Mr Speaker. I'm bringing up a point of order at my earliest convenience, after reading through the Standing Orders. A comment you made, Mr Speaker, around a member, a kaumātua, advising Māori not to take the vaccination, when, in actual fact, there is an article in the Waateanews.com, if that's not a viable source of report, where Mr Bird says, ""My body is my body. It belongs to me. It does not belong to the State. I will make the decision for myself. I have my own mind. I am te mana motuhake."" Not once in that article does he talk about advising Māori not to take the vaccine. He is pro—",21/10/2021 14:56
1645,Speech,Speaker," Order! Order! The member will resume his seat. If the member wants to take that matter up with me further, and we can, I'm sure, produce other reports, I don't want to undermine Waatea News, but it's not my general place of reading and, therefore, I was not relying on that report. I'm just saying, because there appear to be another couple of members who feel like giving assistance on this matter, don't try it.",21/10/2021 14:57
1646,Speech,Speaker," Members, at the request of the Minister of Health, I'm going to rule on concerns about replies to written questions. Ministers have a responsibility to the House and through the House to the country to account for the public offices they hold. Questions are an important element of this accountability and Ministers should therefore take questions seriously and endeavour to give informative replies to questions they are asked. Speakers' ruling 186/5 applies equally to oral and written questions. Consistent with the importance of questions, I remind Ministers that they should not commence answers to questions with a political attack—Speaker's ruling 191/3. This is especially true of answers to written questions which do not contain political statements and are not asked in the heat of the debating chamber. ",20/10/2021 14:00
1647,a,Speaker,"Generally, where a member is concerned with a reply to written questions, they are expected to raise it with the Minister first—Speakers' ruling 196/4. However, when an answer commences with an unnecessary political attack on another party and especially when the matter has been raised in the past, it is reasonable that a member raises it directly with the Speaker. For the sake of clarity I am now ruling that such matters may be brought immediately to the Speaker's attention without raising them with the Minister first. ",20/10/2021 14:00
1648,a,Speaker,"Finally, I would remind Ministers that I endeavour to be courteous and helpful in my written correspondence with members and I would appreciate that approach being reciprocated.",20/10/2021 14:00
1649,Speech,Chris Hipkins," Point of order, Mr Speaker. I wonder if you could also look at the nature of some of the questions that are being lodged. As a result of a decision that you made—I think it was earlier this year—to allow more than two legs to a written question, the nature of some of the written questions has become more political, and in terms of the nature of the exchange that we have here in the House, I think there has generally been an approach that if a member asks a particularly political question, then they can expect a particularly political answer. Now that questions can be longer and can contain more quotations and statements, by definition they often are becoming more political in nature, and I think it would be somewhat unfair to say that a question can be more highly political but an answer to it could not be.",20/10/2021 14:02
1650,Speech,Speaker," I will be absolutely willing to look at that if members choose to bring them to me. The ruling that I attempted to make in the past was not to allow more quotations but to allow multiple legs in order to have Ministers answer one question rather than 200 or 300 containing very similar information. It was an attempt to make it easier for the House and to make the system more efficient, and I'm quite happy, if Ministers feel that written questions are outside either the letter or the spirit, for them to bring them to me directly.",20/10/2021 14:03
1651,Speech,Chris Hipkins," Just further clarifying what I was saying, Mr Speaker, I guess what I was asking is that where members who are receiving an answer raise with you the political nature of the answer, in assessing whether any further action is taken you'll consider the nature of question that has been asked.",20/10/2021 14:04
1652,Speech,Speaker," Absolutely, and I did on about half a dozen occasions in this case.",20/10/2021 14:04
1653,Speech,Dr Elizabeth Kerekere, I seek leave to move a motion without notice or debate mō he tohu aroha [as a sign of respect] for the passing of Sean Wainui.,20/10/2021 14:04

Sir Michael was Deputy Prime Minister from 2002 to 2008.

1664,a,Speaker,"I move, That the House note that in September 1951, the inaugural conference of Te Rōpū Wāhine Māori Toko i te Ora, the Māori Women's Welfare League, was held in Wellington, with the late Dame Whina Cooper elected as its first president, and that the House celebrate the role of Te Rōpū Wāhine Māori Toko i te Ora in the advancement, enablement, and empowerment of Māori women and whānau. ",29/09/2021 14:00
1665,Speech,Chris Hipkins," I move, That this House approve the following orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020:",28/09/2021 14:56
1666,a,Chris Hipkins,"First, by way of background, as we do when we confirm these orders, under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act, as the responsible Minister, I am able to issue a variety of orders that compel people to do things or to not do things depending on the situation as part of our overall public health response when it comes to dealing with COVID-19. The orders that I issue, if they are not confirmed by a motion in the House, are revoked after a certain time frame. I therefore have to put the motion down on the Order Paper for those orders to be confirmed. That motion and the relevant orders are then referred to the Regulations Review Committee, who scrutinise my use of the power that I am given under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act. They have the ability to raise issues both with me as the Minister responsible and also with the House, a. And so we are now dealing with a motion to confirm three of the orders that have now been scrutinised by the Regulations Review Committee under that particular process. ",28/09/2021 14:56
1667,a,Chris Hipkins,"I would note that the orders that we are talking about here are all amendment orders. There are, basically, two reasons why I amend orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act. The first is that many of these orders have been put in place in a hurry, and there will undoubtedly be improvements that can be made, corrections that need to be made to them, further refinements, and so on. So, yes, there are a number of amendments that fall into that category. The second, of course, is that the situation is constantly changing and constantly evolving, and, as a result, we often need to constantly amend these orders. We're not confirming any alert level orders made in this particular batch of approvals, but alert level orders are a really good example of where we need to constantly move and adapt and change, depending on the circumstances in front of us. ",28/09/2021 14:56
1668,a,Chris Hipkins,"So there are three orders that we're confirming today, and I'll quickly run through those. The first is the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) Amendment Order (No 9). This is the second air border order that's been put in place, and this one's already been amended nine times. This set of amendments removes ""Australia"" and references to Australia, particularly when it comes to talking about quarantine-free travel, on the basis that there are no longer any quarantine-free flights from Australia to New Zealand. It does not preclude us reintroducing quarantine-free travel with Australia in the future. That order came into force at 11.59 p.m. back on 11 August. ",28/09/2021 14:56
1669,a,Chris Hipkins,"The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) Amendment Order (No 10) of 2021: this particular amendment added Fiji and Indonesia to the list of very high-risk countries. By being designated as a very high-risk country, it means that we are significantly limiting the number of people who can travel from that country to New Zealand. We're narrowing that down to only New Zealand citizens who are returning home, and it does provide for some new or expanded exemptions, which include the dependent children of New Zealand citizens who are coming home; persons transiting through New Zealand while travelling from Fiji to another destination outside of New Zealand, recognising that at the moment, New Zealand is, effectively, the only regular gateway to and from Fiji; and people involved in medical transfers from Fiji to New Zealand. ",28/09/2021 14:56
1670,a,Chris Hipkins,"The order also removes Fiji from the list of low-risk designations for the purposes of quarantine-free travel. That has an implication for aircrew members who have undertaken any flight to or from Fiji in the 14-day period before their arrival in New Zealand on a quarantine-free flight, and that means that they must have a negative result for COVID-19 before they come. That order came into force at 11.59 p.m. on 15 August.",28/09/2021 14:56
1671,a,Chris Hipkins,"The final order is the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Required Testing) Amendment Order (No 3). This order amends the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Required Testing) Order to allow people who are required to undergo regular COVID-19 surveillance testing and medical examination to elect to undergo regular saliva testing as an alternative to the nasal pharyngeal swabs that they currently have to take. The order also sets out the duties for the people who make that choice, as well as the record-keeping duties for the people who are conducting the business undertaking with respect to those particular people.",28/09/2021 14:56
1672,a,Chris Hipkins,"The Regulations Review Committee did raise an issue with regard to this particular order. They were concerned around the clarity around the frequency of the testing requirement, recognising that saliva testing will need to be more frequent than the nasal pharyngeal swabs. I've considered closely the feedback from the Regulations Review Committee. I am comfortable that the order is clear and that there isn't ambiguity there, but as we continue to refine and test the orders, we will look and see whether there is simpler language that could be used in future orders just to remove any potential suggestion that that's not clear. So that particular order came into force at 11.59 p.m. on 11 August 2021.",28/09/2021 14:56
1673,a,Chris Hipkins,"Finally, I just want to thank all those who were involved in putting these orders together. I'm often waiting up till quite late in the evening to sign the orders in order for them to come in force—typically, just before midnight—because these orders, as I said, are often put in place in quite a hurry, and the people who have to draft them often have to do so under significant time pressure. So I want to thank them for their work. ",28/09/2021 14:56
1674,a,Chris Hipkins,"By and large, they get it right. They've served us incredibly well. There are undoubtedly improvements that they identify and would have been able to identify had we given them more time in the drafting, but, ultimately, we are able to pick those up with future amendments. It is a pretty nimble piece of legislation that we're making the orders under, and I think that our COVID-19 response overall is the better for it.",28/09/2021 14:56
1675,Speech,Speaker, The question is that the motion be agreed to. ,28/09/2021 15:03
1676,Speech,Speaker," Before we move on to oral questions, I do want to apologise to members for an incorrect comment that I made yesterday when I was under the impression that Mr Bishop had used the Leader of the Opposition's mike in interjecting. In fact, I have been informed that the microphone was turned off at the time and that any amplification would have come from my microphones and not from the Leader of the Opposition's. I also want to apologise to the staff whose job it is to make sure that the feed that goes publicly works well. I checked; it did work well. They work the volume controls in order for the outside feed, but, unfortunately, it doesn't help me in here. As a point of compromise, and I'll relay this to the member concerned, I've turned my hearing aids down. So if he's in the same position, if he turns his volume down, we might get the appropriate compromise.",22/09/2021 14:01
1677,Speech,Speaker," I just want to do a quick ruling, members, before I call the next member. I want to inform the House about the reprinting of a bill introduced today. The COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill was introduced today, but a bill with that title has already been introduced into this Parliament. Therefore, I have ordered the bill be reprinted with the title ""COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill (No 2)"". I apologise to the House for the errors that have occurred resulting in this having to happen.",21/09/2021 17:36

I want to, on behalf of the Government, acknowledge all of the Paralympians who were members of the team competing in Tokyo, and congratulate them collectively on their achievements. Our team contained 18 new Paralympians. Their performance gives us enormous confidence for the future of para-sport. This truly has been a Paralympics that has captured hearts and minds of New Zealanders and provided countless hours of incredible and inspiring sporting moments, including six gold, three silver, and three bronze medals for the New Zealand team. ",9/09/2021 14:00
1681,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Among the achievements, it is hard to go past New Zealand's greatest Paralympian, Sophie Pascoe. She once again showed the world what an absolute champion she is, winning two gold, a silver, and a bronze medal from her five events in the pool. She returned the biggest individual medal haul for the Paralympic team, and now sits on a career tally of 19. Sophie is a legend: a dedicated trainer, a tough competitor, a leader, and a mentor. She is truly one of our finest ever sportspeople.",9/09/2021 14:00
1682,a,Jacinda Ardern,"I'd also like to congratulate Tupou Neiufi, the pride of South Auckland, for her breakthrough gold in the 100-metre backstroke S8, a first for New Zealand. Lisa Adams and Anna Grimaldi both set Paralympic records with their gold medals in shot put F37 and long jump T47 respectively, and Holly Robinson claimed a rather nerve-wracking gold in javelin F46 when she left it to her sixth and final throw to move from third to first and claim the title. Holly's determination after getting silver in both London and Rio has been well rewarded. Holly's coach, Raylene Bates, deserves enormous congratulations for her commitment to training para-athletes, and shares in the success of this team. Young track stars William Stedman and Danielle Aitchison also shone at these Paralympic Games, with William snaring silver in the long jump T36 and bronze in the 400 metres T36, and Danielle winning silver in the 200 metres T36 and bronze in the 100 metres T36.

I understand from the member's letter that he was aware of this issue on 6 September, but sought to clarify some accounts before making his application. However, he could have applied for an urgent debate before the House sat yesterday. There was also an opportunity to raise the matter with the Minister for COVID-19 Response during the Estimates debate. The fact that a member does not raise a matter at the earliest opportunity may be taken as an indication that it is not of sufficient urgency to qualify under Standing Order 399, but it does not automatically rule it out. ",8/09/2021 14:35
1689,a,Speaker,"The matter that the member wishes to debate appears to have been a possible clinical error. While Ministers answer to the House for the health system and the response to COVID-19, the concept of administrative or ministerial responsibility is narrower for urgent debates than for oral questions. The fact that questions have been addressed to a Minister does not necessarily mean that it involves ministerial responsibility on which an urgent debate can be founded—Speakers' ruling 200/4, from Dr Smith and a more recent one. Having considered the matters raised by the member in his letter, I'm not convinced that it reaches the threshold that warrants setting aside the business of the House. The application is therefore declined. ",8/09/2021 14:35
1690,Speech,Chairperson," The House in committee for further consideration of the Appropriation (2021/22 Estimates) Bill. There are five hours and 27 minutes left remaining in this debate. All votes are available for debate, but only the Minister of Immigration and the Minister of Justice will be available to speak to the indicated portfolios. The first call in each debate will be offered to the chairperson or member of the committee that's considered the Estimates most closely related to the Minister's portfolios. The Estimates debate should be relevant to the Government's current spending plans as contained in the Estimates of Appropriations. The question is that the votes contained in the Estimates of Appropriations 2021 stand part of the schedules—in this case, immigration.",8/09/2021 15:39
1691,Speech,Andrew Little, I wish to make a ministerial statement on last week's terrorist attack in Auckland.,7/09/2021 14:00
1692,a,Andrew Little,"At around 2.40 p.m. last Friday, 3 September, a known ideologically motivated violent extremist entered the Countdown supermarket at LynnMall in Auckland's New Lynn. While in the supermarket, the individual took a knife from the shelves and used to it to attack six innocent shoppers, and a seventh person was also injured. A police team surveilling the terrorist intervened, shot, and killed him. The terrorist acted alone; we are confident of that.",7/09/2021 14:00
1693,a,Andrew Little,"I acknowledge the injured victims of this attack. Seven people have been hurt. Four were in a critical condition when they were admitted to hospital that evening. All are now stable or recovering, and we wish them well for their ongoing recovery. I also acknowledge the Countdown staff and the shoppers in the mall who rendered aid to the victims and otherwise assisted. For everyone who was in the vicinity of this attack, I know it will have caused shock and deep distress, and I trust they will be receiving the support they need from their employer or from Victim Support.",7/09/2021 14:00
1694,a,Andrew Little,"I acknowledge the bravery of the New Zealand Police officers who have been part of the surveillance operation over this terrorist during the last several weeks. Police knew what they were dealing with, and the risks that they and the community were facing. Tragically, the world does now too. The nature of police work means officers face danger every day. In this case, the Police surveillance team stood between this individual—one of the most dangerous in New Zealand—and the rest of the community. So to the Police I say: thank you.",7/09/2021 14:00
1695,a,Andrew Little,"While much of their work must necessarily be carried out in secrecy, I wanted to put on record the work of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS) and what they did over many years to protect the community from this terrorist. The NZSIS identified the individual in 2016 from his disturbing online activities. He remained a person of interest ever since, with the SIS continually appraising and reappraising the risk he posed. The intelligence collected by the SIS was vital to supporting the Police and other authorities to minimise and manage that risk.",7/09/2021 14:00
1696,a,Andrew Little,"Nevertheless, despite the very best efforts of so many, the terrorist did carry out a violent attack. We must learn the lessons from this attack so we can keep the community safe in the future. Inquiries by the coroner and the Independent Police Conduct Authority will be vital to this.",7/09/2021 14:00
1697,a,Andrew Little,"At this stage I can report the following facts about the terrorist's background. On 14 July 2011, he applied for a student visa. A national security check was returned with no comment the following month. He arrived in New Zealand from Sri Lanka in October 2011. Just two weeks later, he applied for asylum. I can say that the basis of that claim was not a fear of the Government of Sri Lanka. In April 2012, his asylum claim was unsuccessful; he was found to be lacking in credibility. He appealed that decision to the Immigration and Protection Tribunal. In December 2013, he was granted refugee status by the tribunal. He subsequently became a permanent resident.",7/09/2021 14:00
1698,a,Andrew Little,"In 2016, the SIS became aware of disturbing online activity by the individual, and an investigation was initiated. Over the years, the SIS has committed considerable resources to monitoring the threat posed by the individual because of his threatening actions.",7/09/2021 14:00
1699,a,Andrew Little,"In May 2017, the individual attempted to leave New Zealand for Malaysia—although it is believed his intended destination was Syria, where he intended to join Daesh. On investigation, he was found in possession of offensive propaganda material consistent with his ideologically motivated violent extremism. He was also found in possession of a large hunting knife. He was arrested and charged with offences relating to objectionable material and offensive weapons.",7/09/2021 14:00
1700,a,Andrew Little,"To be clear, as a country, we had an obligation to prevent this person travelling to pursue his terrorist ambitions. He was remanded in custody until around June 2018 when he pleaded guilty to the objectionable material offence and was sentenced to supervision. Shortly after his release, the individual purchased another hunting knife and continued seeking and distributing objectionable material online. He was arrested and remanded in custody.",7/09/2021 14:00
1701,a,Andrew Little,"In August 2017, the Refugee Status Unit began a review of the individual's refugee status, with a request for consideration whether he should be deported. In January 2018, Immigration New Zealand reopened his case, and in April of that year he requested cancellation of his permanent resident visa. His reasons for doing so are unclear.",7/09/2021 14:00
1702,a,Andrew Little,"On 1 June 2018, he was served with a notice of cancellation of his refugee status on the basis of fraud. On 1 February 2019, his refugee status was cancelled. Later, in April 2019, the individual lodged an appeal against the cancellation of his refugee status. On 8 July this year, it was deemed that the individual was likely a protected person. A question remained about whether he would be eligible for deportation because of his immigration status, and this was yet to be tested in the courts. ",7/09/2021 14:00
1703,a,Andrew Little,"Despite many attempts to prevent it, the individual was released on bail from prison on 13 July this year. On release, he was immediately placed under intense surveillance, including by the Police with support from the Special Tactics Group.",7/09/2021 14:00
1704,a,Andrew Little,"Through the terrorist's long periods of time spent in prison, Corrections worked closely with partner agencies to keep the community and Corrections staff safe from the extreme risk that his violent extremist ideology presented. Corrections presently has no ability to compel an offender to take part in rehabilitation activities. Attempts were made to provide him with mental health support while he was in prison, but he refused to engage. He also refused to meet with a Corrections psychologist while in prison. With support from the countering violent extremism forum, Corrections engaged with the local Muslim community with the intention of having an imam meet with him regarding his spiritual beliefs. He met with the imam twice; however, he did not engage in any meaningful way.",7/09/2021 14:00
1705,a,Andrew Little,"Regarding more generally taking action based on the individual's mental health, I note that the Mental Health Foundation of New Zealand has said the individual did not meet the criteria to be involuntarily assessed under the Mental Health Act, and he did not meet the criteria to be sectioned under the Act. I expect that the coroner might investigate any role that mental health issues played in the terrible events that have transpired.",7/09/2021 14:00
1706,a,Andrew Little,"At all times, Government and agencies attempted every legal avenue available to deport the terrorist and to keep him detained and out of the community while we did so. When we couldn't keep him in custody, agencies took the extraordinary step of keeping him under constant police surveillance and followed by the Special Tactics Group when he was in public. All agencies were doing all that could be done to protect New Zealanders, and ultimately we were frustrated by the law dealing with terrorist activity as it currently stands.",7/09/2021 14:00
1707,a,Andrew Little,"It is important to turn briefly to that law now. In November 2007, the then Solicitor-General found the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 was unworkable. Among other deficiencies, the Act was found not to contain a criminal offence of planning or preparation for a terrorist attack.",7/09/2021 14:00
1708,a,Andrew Little,"Work on addressing that gap in the law did not commence until August 2018. This Government directed officials to commence the policy work required—and it was a very significant piece of work because of the interplay between security, individual freedoms, and human rights. We have also been informed in that work by the report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the terrorist attack on Christchurch masjidain on 15 March 2019. The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Bill is due to be reported back from the select committee very shortly. As the Prime Minister has said publicly, it is the Government's intention to pass the bill this month.",7/09/2021 14:00
1709,a,Andrew Little,"There is more to be done. I want to conclude by echoing the words of the Prime Minister: last week's attack was terrorism carried out by an individual—not a faith, not a culture, not an ethnicity. The individual was gripped by ideology that is not supported here by anyone or any community. The terrorist alone carries the responsibility for his acts.",7/09/2021 14:00
1710,a,Andrew Little,"To those hurt in the attack, and to those in the supermarket and at the mall who witnessed it, we are sorry that this has happened to you. We have now experienced two terrorist attacks that were motivated by different—but no less insidious and repugnant—violent extremist ideologies. New Zealand was not immune to the threat of terrorist violence in March 2019 and we are not immune now and we will not be in the future. It is time for a more mature national discussion about national security than we have had in the past, and now, as legislators—and as a country—we must move forward and do what we can do to ensure it never happens again.",7/09/2021 14:00
1711,Speech,Speaker," I have received a letter from the Hon Judith Collins seeking to debate under Standing Order 399 the terrorist attack on shoppers in a New Lynn supermarket, and Government actions leading up to the attack. This is a particular case of recent occurrence and there is ministerial responsibility for the actions of Government in relation to the terrorist. Under the Policing Act 2008, the Police Commissioner acts independently of the Government in enforcement of the law in relation to any individual and the investigation and the prosecution of offences. These are not matters for which Ministers can answer to the House. Members have had the opportunity to question a Minister on this matter following the ministerial statement. Legislation to address the counter-terrorism aspects of this case will be debated in the House in the near future. However, there are many more elements to this matter, including issues relating to our security services, Immigration, Corrections, and Justice, and it is likely that more than one member from the main Opposition party will want to raise questions across those portfolio areas. The ministerial statement today did not provide adequate scope for such a broad and important debate. Therefore, I call on the Hon Judith Collins to move that the House take note of a matter of urgent public importance.",7/09/2021 15:21
1712,Speech,Chairperson, I declare the House in committee for further consideration of the Appropriation (2021/22 Estimates) Bill. ,7/09/2021 16:41
1713,a,Chairperson,"The House is in committee for further consideration of the Appropriation (2021/22 Estimates) Bill. There are seven hours and 36 minutes remaining in the debate. All Votes are available for debate, but only the Minister of Finance and for Infrastructure, the Minister for COVID-19 Response, and the Minister of Education will be available today to speak to the indicated portfolios only. ",7/09/2021 16:41
1714,a,Chairperson,"The first call in each debate will be offered to the chairperson or a member of the committee that considered the Estimates most closely related to the Minister's portfolio. The Estimates debate should be relevant to the Government's current spending plans as contained in the Estimates of Appropriations, and I'll remind members that under the relatively recent rules, we have the ability to be interactive, to go back and forth, to share times, and to have interrogations. ",7/09/2021 16:41
1715,a,Chairperson,The question is that the Votes contained in the Estimates of Appropriations for 2021-22 stand part of the schedules.,7/09/2021 16:41
1716,Speech,Michael Woodhouse," I thank the Leader of the House for that update and also for the constructive discussions that are going on about the programme for next week. A couple of matters: firstly, recognising that there has been quite a bit of lost time, can I encourage him, as I'm sure he will, to signal early to the Business Committee if it will be necessary for the House to take urgency or extended hours in the fourth quarter of this year.",2/09/2021 14:02
1717,a,Michael Woodhouse,"Secondly, Mr Speaker, I seek a point of order. I seek leave for the Speaker to chair the committee of the whole House on the Appropriation (2021/22 Estimates) Bill and that while the Speaker chairs the committee, no motion to report to obtain the Speaker's ruling on a matter of procedure can be accepted, despite Standing Orders 173 and 179.",2/09/2021 14:02
1718,Speech,Speaker, Is there any objection to that course of action? There appears to be none.,2/09/2021 14:03
1719,Speech,Chris Hipkins," I move, That this House approve the following orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020:",1/09/2021 15:35
1720,a,Chris Hipkins,- COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations) Amendment Order 2021,1/09/2021 15:35
1721,a,Chris Hipkins,- COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) Amendment Order (No 7) 2021,1/09/2021 15:35
1722,a,Chris Hipkins,- COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) Amendment Order (No 8) 2021.,1/09/2021 15:35
1723,a,Chris Hipkins,"Once again, I'm before the House asking for orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act to be confirmed. To recap, for those who are unfamiliar with this particular process, the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act authorises me, as the Minister for COVID-19 Response, or the responsible Minister, to use the correct term, to issue orders requiring people to do things or requiring people not to do to things in response to COVID-19. Those orders can have almost immediate effect—this is something that we absolutely require in dealing with a global pandemic—but they do need to be subject to scrutiny. The process that we are involved in now is exactly how this unfolds. When I put an order in place, I then have to bring it to the House within a certain period of time to be confirmed. If it is not confirmed within that period of time, then the order that I've made expires. When I put a motion on the Order Paper for an order to be confirmed, it's referred immediately to the Regulations Review Committee who can then review the order, make sure that it is in compliance with the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act, make sure that it is not using that Act in a way that is inappropriate. They can also make recommendations both back to me as the person who signs the order but also to the House. Their report then comes back to the House, and then I have the ability to move the motion which I've just moved to confirm the order.",1/09/2021 15:35
1724,a,Chris Hipkins,"In terms of what this particular motion confirms, it confirms three—so first of all, I should probably say thank you again to the Regulations Review Committee. I've had a very constructive relationship with them. They have asked questions of me and of my officials. They have made suggestions. In some cases, we have subsequently adopted those suggestions because they have been good suggestions in continuing to improve our COVID-19 response framework.",1/09/2021 15:35
1725,a,Chris Hipkins,"I do want to just acknowledge too, though, that many of these orders are put in place very quickly at short notice. Undoubtedly, there are improvements that can be made, and that's why we'll see that some of those orders have already been amended many, many times, both to deal with the emerging situation, but also, in some cases, to tidy up and correct not necessarily errors or mistakes that have been made but inconsistencies, or orders have sometimes lacked the clarity that we would aim for if we had a longer period of time to put them in place. So some of the amendments that we approve in this House fall into all of those different categories.",1/09/2021 15:35
1726,a,Chris Hipkins,"So the three that we are confirming: one is quite a significant one and the others are relatively small points of clarification. So the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations) Amendment Order 2021 extends the vaccination requirement for our border workforce to a broader number of people. We have had in place a requirement that those working in our managed isolation and quarantine facilities have to be vaccinated in order to undertake the work. That's been in place for some time, and many of our front-line border workers have had to be vaccinated. Again, that has been in place for a period of time. We are now expanding that to a wider range of people, and that is what this order confirms. It is important that we provide the greatest layer of defence using vaccination in our border as possible. We've been working to achieve that over the course of 2021, since vaccines became available. This order extends that to a broader number of people.",1/09/2021 15:35
1727,a,Chris Hipkins,"The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) Amendment Order (No 7) 2021 makes some relatively minor clarifications around quarantine-free travel and who's eligible to participate in quarantine-free travel and the requirements about that. I would foreshadow at this point, that, of course, all of our arrangements around quarantine-free travel are under review during this time, where the bulk of quarantine-free travel is paused. In fact, the only current quarantine-free travel we have at the moment that could still be reactivated is Cook Islands, and at the moment it's paused at their end for very good reason. So we have a much more limited scale of quarantine-free travel at the moment, so we are using that opportunity to review all of the orders we've got in place around that.",1/09/2021 15:35
1728,a,Chris Hipkins,"Then the final one is the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) Amendment Order (No 8) 2021, which makes some clarifications around the treatment of diplomats, consular officials, and certain New Zealand Defence Force members when it comes to the relationship between those people and quarantine-free travel, just so that all of the requirements that are in place for people coming into the country are as clear as they possibly can be.",1/09/2021 15:35
1729,a,Chris Hipkins,"So, like I said, the first of the orders is a relatively substantive one. In my view, the second two are tidying-up orders, making the arrangements as clear as possible and tidying up any inconsistencies or ambiguity that exists within the orders. I do want to acknowledge the way the House functions when it comes to these orders and the degree of goodwill that is shown across the House to scrutinising them appropriately through the Regulations Review Committee, something that I regard as very, very important. I hope that that process will continue in that spirit.",1/09/2021 15:35
1730,Speech,Chris Hipkins," Thank you, Mr Speaker. I wish to make a ministerial statement on the changes to COVID-19 alert levels.",31/08/2021 14:00
1731,a,Chris Hipkins,"On Tuesday afternoon, 17 August 2021, we were advised of a case in the community with no obvious connection to the border. In a matter of hours after this, the Cabinet had met and agreed a move for all of New Zealand to COVID-19 alert level 4 from 11.59 p.m. that evening. It's now 14 days since COVID-19 re-emerged in the community and New Zealand moved to alert level 4. It was news that nobody wanted. The events of the last two weeks, however, have once again confirmed the value of going hard and going early. Elimination remains New Zealand's best strategy, and we are throwing everything at it.",31/08/2021 14:00
1732,a,Chris Hipkins,"On Monday, 23 August, Cabinet agreed to extend alert level 4 for the rest of the country, and yesterday Cabinet also confirmed a decision from last week to move all of New Zealand south of Auckland down to alert level 3 from 11.59 p.m. this evening. Cabinet also agreed to keep Auckland at alert level 4 until at least 11.59 p.m. on Tuesday, 14 September, with a review of those settings on Monday, 6 September.",31/08/2021 14:00
1733,a,Chris Hipkins,"Unfortunately, the latest outbreak has particularly affected Auckland. Once again, Auckland is doing the heavy lifting, and we acknowledge their immense efforts and the sacrifices they are making for us all. Based on the size of the current outbreak, based on the number of daily cases we're seeing, and based on the need to sustain reduction in cases before moving alert levels, Auckland will remain at alert level 4 for another two weeks. Northland will move down a level from Thursday if the remaining tests that we are waiting for come back negative.",31/08/2021 14:00
1734,a,Chris Hipkins,"We need to be confident that we do not have COVID-19 Delta circulating undetected in the community, and we need to be confident that any cases we may have are contained and isolated. Signs are encouraging that after the hard work of all New Zealanders, we are seeing the effects of the lockdown starting to turn the tide. We are seeing a decrease in cases outside of households, a decreasing number of locations of interest, and the reproduction rate starting to reduce. That's not to say that we are out of the woods yet. We'll continue to see new cases reported from these Auckland clusters for a while yet.",31/08/2021 14:00
1735,a,Chris Hipkins,"In the last two weeks, we've processed just over 420,000 tests. Our contact tracing has also performed strongly. Approximately 34,500 contacts have been identified, with 28,839—or around 80 percent—being contacted by our National Contact Tracing Solution. Also, a shout-out to our managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) staff. There's no doubt the managed isolation and quarantine system is under pressure, and their incredible and ongoing efforts to help keep us all safe deserve acknowledgement. They are New Zealand's unsung heroes. Our schools, too, are once again stepping up to minimise the disruption to students and their families, and we thank them.",31/08/2021 14:00
1736,a,Chris Hipkins,"We have gratitude for our vaccination workforce, GPs, pharmacies, and Māori and Pasifika health providers. The rate of vaccinations has been increasing, and in the last two weeks we've had more than seven record days, which are averaging approximately 430,000 doses administered per week. In total, 3.4 million doses have been administered, including 2.2 million first doses and nearly 1.2 million second doses. We do know, and I acknowledge that everybody in the House has shown public support for this, that the vaccine is our best defence against COVID-19. It is free of charge and it is safe to use. Vaccine shipments continue to arrive regularly.",31/08/2021 14:00
1737,a,Chris Hipkins,"Throughout our response to COVID-19, we've used the latest evidence and the best advice available to us at the time. We've learnt and we've adapted and we will continue to be guided by the science.",31/08/2021 14:00
1738,a,Chris Hipkins,"Last week, I announced the introduction of mandatory record-keeping for busy places and large gatherings. These are the sorts of places where people gather consistently and in larger numbers, such as cafes, restaurants, bars, casinos, concerts, aged-care facilities, healthcare facilities, barbers, nightclubs, and libraries. It's now mandatory to wear a mask when visiting a business or a service at alert level 4. We've also, based on the latest scientific evidence, widened the gap between vaccines doses from three weeks to six weeks, to get wider population coverage sooner. Of course, we'll continue to follow the science—for example, what it tells us about the most effective timing for booster shots and ongoing vaccinations.",31/08/2021 14:00
1739,a,Chris Hipkins,"All Government border workers in high-risk jobs are now required to be vaccinated, with checks and balances in place to ensure that this is happening. By the end of next month, all those working in jobs at the border that may see a person come into contact with COVID-19 will also need to have been vaccinated. These are measures to protect those doing those jobs and to ensure that we are plugging any further gaps in our border defence. We're doing all of this, and more, while continuing our work on the reconnecting New Zealand strategy, which we announced a few short weeks ago—though it feels a lot longer.",31/08/2021 14:00
1740,a,Chris Hipkins,"It's understandable that New Zealand is totally focused on the here and now and getting to the other side of this outbreak. As I said earlier, the Government is throwing everything at it, but we are also looking ahead. We will not lose sight of the medium- and long-term goals, and I can assure the House that planning for the future also continues apace.",31/08/2021 14:00
1741,a,Chris Hipkins,"Can I end by acknowledging, once again, that the last two weeks have been difficult for a lot of people. No one wanted to see COVID-19 re-emerge in the community, but we always knew that it was possible and that it could happen. We know that the best way to protect our people and our economy is to stamp out this virus, and, thanks to the hard work of all New Zealanders, we are making great progress to do that again.",31/08/2021 14:00
1742,Speech,David Seymour," Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to, first of all, thank the Minister for COVID-19 recovery for his comments and also give, on behalf of ACT, our most heartfelt condolences for those people who are suffering the effects of lockdowns—those people in small business, where people feel enormous stress about their future; those kids who are missing out on educational opportunities; those people who need healthcare and risk being displaced as hospital capacity is reserved for potential COVID cases. New Zealanders have played an extraordinary part, following the rules, getting vaccinations when they're available, and to some extent using QR code scanning, but there remain a number of questions about the Government's response and, in particular, whether or not the Government could have done far more in the past 18 months in order to prepare for the current Delta outbreak, and questions about what it will do next to ensure some greater certainty in future.",31/08/2021 14:21
1743,a,David Seymour,"I'd like to put a few questions to the Minister, particularly in relation to vaccination. The Minister said on 22 August that there were 750,000 doses in the country, having just received a total of 380,000 that weekend. A week later, the Prime Minister told us there were 840,000 doses after an additional 320,000 were received. I'd like the Minister to explain how you can have 750,000, use twice as many as you received, and end up with 90,000 more than you started with?",31/08/2021 14:21
1744,Speech,Chris Hipkins," It's very easily answered: we don't hold all of the vaccines in a central store. There are two different numbers here: there's the number of vaccines in the country that have not been used and the number that are being held in the central store. At the moment, we have over 300,000 in our central store but nearly half a million are out, distributed around our vaccination centres, and have yet to be used.",31/08/2021 14:23
1745,Speech,David Seymour," How, then, does the Minister reconcile his statement that there were 750,000 doses in the country when the Ministry of Health recorded only 459,000 in the central store on the same day?",31/08/2021 14:24
1746,Speech,Chris Hipkins, Because not all of the vaccine doses are stored in the central store; some of them have already been distributed to vaccination sites.,31/08/2021 14:24
1747,Speech,David Seymour," So is the Minister now telling us that there are half a million distributed to vaccination sites at any time, and, if so, can he tell us how many are in the country today?",31/08/2021 14:24
1748,Speech,Chris Hipkins," I don't think the member has been listening to the answers that I've been giving him. I just indicated to him that we've got just over 300,000 in our central store and just under half a million distributed around the country at our vaccination centres. Of course, our vaccination centres are doing a phenomenal rate of vaccinations at the moment, so I cannot give him an up-to-the-minute update of how many they are holding versus how many they have just administered.",31/08/2021 14:24
1749,Speech,David Seymour, Why won't the Government simply publish both numbers if they know them and are able to announce them at press conferences?,31/08/2021 14:25
1750,Speech,Chris Hipkins," As I've indicated to the member—and, again, if he perhaps listens to the answers, he won't need to waste his questioning time—because the answer to that is quite clear: we don't have up-to-the-minute information because we are not asking the vaccination centres to report the number of vaccinations they are doing every minute.",31/08/2021 14:25
1751,Speech,David Seymour," The strategic advice from Professor Sir David Skegg said that New Zealand will have more options for responding to COVID-19 when the vaccination programme is complete. I asked Professor Skegg earlier last week what he meant by the vaccination programme being complete. He said that he had not defined it, instead leaving it for the Government to define. I wonder if the Minister could explain what it is that he thinks of when he talks about the vaccination programme being complete, and how will New Zealanders know it's complete if there is no vaccination target?",31/08/2021 14:25
1752,Speech,Chris Hipkins," The epidemiologists have been very clear that setting a numerical target—particularly a numerical target as low as some Opposition members have been suggesting—is not necessarily the best way forward for New Zealand. Our goal is unambiguous, which is to ensure that every New Zealander who is eligible has the opportunity to get a vaccination by the end of the year and, as we can do so safely, expand eligibility to additional population groups—to younger New Zealanders. The member and the House will have seen that the Government recently made a decision around that, to extend to the 12-plus age cohort who weren't previously eligible, and we've done that once we have been convinced that it is safe to do so.",31/08/2021 14:26
1753,Speech,David Seymour," On what date did the Government first begin discussing with other countries borrowing Pfizer vaccine doses in case of New Zealand facing a shortfall? Was it earlier this year, was it this month, or was it within the last week?",31/08/2021 14:27
1754,Speech,Chris Hipkins, Our discussions with Pfizer and with other potential supply partners around vaccine access for New Zealand have been ongoing. I don't believe it would be in the public interest for me to reveal all of the intricacies of those discussions.,31/08/2021 14:27
1755,Speech,David Seymour," We are not asking for any intricacies; just was it in the last week, the last month, or earlier this year that those discussions began?",31/08/2021 14:27
1756,Speech,Chris Hipkins, Discussions have been ongoing over the last year around vaccine supply.,31/08/2021 14:27
1757,Speech,David Seymour, Were those discussions in relation to borrowing additional Pfizer vaccine doses from other countries?,31/08/2021 14:27
1758,Speech,Chris Hipkins," There have been discussions with other countries since the beginning of the vaccination programme around vaccination supply. All countries have been grappling with this. Of course, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade network, our political leaders, and others have been in discussions around vaccine supply since before vaccines were even approved.",31/08/2021 14:28
1759,Speech,David Seymour," Has he, his officials, or anybody in the Ministry of Health at all—or the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, for that matter—offered to pay additional money to Pfizer, as Canada has done, to get additional doses faster? Have they discussed with AstraZeneca getting additional vaccine doses in the last two months? Or is it the case, as the Prime Minister alluded to this morning, that it is not possible to have vaccines from other suppliers, because the supply chain just isn't set up to distribute them?",31/08/2021 14:28
1760,Speech,Chris Hipkins," In answer to the question around AstraZeneca, the New Zealand Government remains committed to a Pfizer-based vaccination campaign at this point, and that is what we are absolutely focused on.",31/08/2021 14:29
1761,a,Chris Hipkins,"In terms of the issue around Canada, what the member refers to is some discussions that the Canadians undertook with Pfizer late last year, when the Pfizer vaccine was still in its very early stages of production, to increase production in order to facilitate access to a very limited number—and we are talking hundreds of thousands of doses, not millions of doses—in the early part of their emergency vaccine approval process, which is not something the New Zealand Government has done. I have had conversations directly with representatives of Pfizer to discuss this issue. Pfizer have been very clear: their production, the production that they have of the vaccine, is fully committed around the globe and they are not willing to offer rich countries the opportunity to pay more in order to displace countries who cannot afford to do that—which suggests that big pharma has a higher ethical and moral standard than the ACT Party does.",31/08/2021 14:29
1762,Speech,David Seymour," Ah, well! Of the 17 cases announced today that were not in households with existing cases, can the Minister tell us how many of them were infected after level 4 conditions commenced? And if he doesn't have access to today's numbers, would he be able to tell us how many of the cases that have been reported from outside existing infected households were infected outside that household since level 4 began?",31/08/2021 14:30
1763,Speech,Chris Hipkins," No, I don't have that information in the form that the member asks for. Dealing with data around case investigations is always one of the big challenges when you're dealing with an outbreak of the size we're dealing with, where there's over 600 cases. The key thing, I think, the public would want assurance of is that the people who need to know the various information about each one of those 600-plus cases do know that information, and that they are providing information to us in as timely a manner as possible to support decision making. I don't have the particular breakdown of data that the member has asked for.",31/08/2021 14:30
1764,Speech,Speaker, The time for the Opposition is concluded. There is an opportunity for reply if the Minister wishes.,31/08/2021 14:31
1765,Speech,Peeni Henare," Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise to make a ministerial statement relating to the New Zealand Defence Force's (NZDF's) involvement in the evacuation from Afghanistan. ",31/08/2021 14:31
1766,a,Peeni Henare,"Tuatahi māku ka tangi atu ki ngā aituā maha ka pā ki roto ki tēnei tūāhuatanga, haere atu rā koutou. [Firstly, I wish to mourn the many who have died, having been caught up in this situation, may you rest in peace.]",31/08/2021 14:31
1767,a,Peeni Henare,"First, I wish to acknowledge those who have passed throughout this terrible time. I want to acknowledge the more than 3,500 NZDF and other agency personnel and veterans and, in particular, the 10 New Zealanders who lost their lives during the 20-year deployment to improve regional security and development in Afghanistan. ",31/08/2021 14:31
1768,a,Peeni Henare,"I would also like to acknowledge the opportunity today to speak to recent events in Afghanistan. I welcome the interest of the public and members of Parliament in the significant and complex developments in Afghanistan over the previous weeks. These are important issues, and ones that will continue to impact the global community for months and years to come.",31/08/2021 14:31
1769,a,Peeni Henare,"On 19 August, I and a group of ministerial colleagues whom Cabinet had appointed with powers to act for this operation approved the deployment of an NZDF C-130 Hercules aircraft and up to 80 NZDF personnel, some to operate on the ground at the Kabul airport and the remainder to be based out of an airbase in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).",31/08/2021 14:31
1770,a,Peeni Henare,"We had NZDF personnel on the ground at Kabul airport within four days of the ministerial decision to deploy our Defence Force to support the international efforts to evacuate and resettle civilians from Afghanistan. These personnel were able to get to work executing the instructions of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) and Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment colleagues, making this a truly interagency effort. ",31/08/2021 14:31
1771,a,Peeni Henare,"That is an exceptionally fast response, considering the complexity of the operating environment and the unfolding situation at the time. This demonstrates the high levels of training that the NZDF maintains to deliver its primary output of military operations to the Government and people of Aotearoa New Zealand. ",31/08/2021 14:31
1772,a,Peeni Henare,"During the deployment, the NZDF C-130 Hercules and crew made three evacuation flights to and from Kabul airport, succeeding in evacuating a number of civilians from Afghanistan, as part of the wider coalition effort. ",31/08/2021 14:31
1773,a,Peeni Henare,"I also want to specifically commend the bravery, tenacity, and resilience of our ground forces who operated from the heart of Afghanistan at the Kabul airport throughout the deployment. These personnel made an extremely valuable contribution. Of particular note are the outstanding efforts of our special forces personnel, including a female engagement team, located at Kabul airport. This team made contact with approved evacuees and guided them through the crowds to points on the perimeter where they could be brought into the airport, secured, and safely evacuated.",31/08/2021 14:31
1774,a,Peeni Henare,"The NZDF deployment concluded its operations out of Kabul airport on 26 August. The US had signalled that the military airlift would conclude by 31 August and that partners would need to depart days earlier than this, as the final days would be reserved for the US' withdrawal of its significant numbers of personnel. ",31/08/2021 14:31
1775,a,Peeni Henare,"The threat of terrorist attack was also a factor in the decision to conclude our activities out of Kabul airport when we did, as highlighted by the Prime Minister and the Chief of Defence Force in their media stand-up on the matter on Friday, 27 August. By that time, MFAT had advised people not to come to Kabul airport. Sadly, that threat materialised in the early hours of 27 August, New Zealand time, with the heinous act of terror perpetrated by the Islamic State in Khorasan Province that we witnessed outside the Kabul airport mere hours after the NZDF presence had withdrawn.",31/08/2021 14:31
1776,a,Peeni Henare,"I want to reiterate the Prime Minister's statements on Friday in relation to this. We condemn this despicable attack on the innocent trying to flee to a better life, and on those trying to escort them safely to their flight to freedom. New Zealand's thoughts and aroha are with the families of the civilians and US personnel who, sadly, lost their lives.",31/08/2021 14:31
1777,a,Peeni Henare,"It is important to recognise the close cooperation and partnership with our closest defence partners throughout this deployment, including the US, Australia, the UK, and Canada. It is clear that without the US' leadership and forces on the ground at the Kabul airport, the evacuation would not have been able to occur. The contributions of the UK and Canada were also central.",31/08/2021 14:31
1778,a,Peeni Henare,"But I must especially recognise the true comradeship and partnership between our NZDF deployment and the Australian Defence Force deployment. We have jointly provided airlift for each other's evacuees, supported each other on the ground in Afghanistan and in the UAE, and we have benefitted hugely from this cooperation. This deployment has shown that the Anzac spirit is alive and well.",31/08/2021 14:31
1779,a,Peeni Henare,I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the stalwart support and hospitality of the UAE Government in permitting the NZDF to operate from the UAE for this deployment. I spoke with my UAE counterpart last week and can confirm the close and meaningful defence relationship we have with the UAE. ,31/08/2021 14:31
1780,a,Peeni Henare,The military-led evacuation effort from Afghanistan has now concluded. We were not the masters of this time frame and we did all that we could do to evacuate people within the time that we had. ,31/08/2021 14:31
1781,a,Peeni Henare,"We knew this was a risk, given the short time frame of the international evacuation, and the Prime Minister mentioned this last week. And I know this is a weight that rests heavy on all the agencies who formed part of the truly interagency New Zealand contribution to the Afghanistan international military evacuation. ",31/08/2021 14:31
1782,a,Peeni Henare,"We are not turning our backs on those still in Afghanistan; we will continue to see how we can support those seeking to leave Afghanistan. However, that will no longer be a military-led effort which the NZDF will feature so prominently in. It will also be within a much larger international effort that New Zealand will be a part of. ",31/08/2021 14:31
1783,a,Peeni Henare,"Finally, I would like to conclude by again acknowledging the bravery and service of our Defence Force personnel who have conducted this deployment under incredibly difficult circumstances. I know that I speak for all New Zealanders when I state how proud I am of what they have achieved and how they have demonstrated the force for good that Aotearoa New Zealand is on the world stage.",31/08/2021 14:31
1784,Speech,Speaker," Members, just a brief ruling. While the House is sitting with parts of the country at alert levels 3 and 4, I will apply my discretion about giving the call in debates slightly differently. If a party does not wish to take a call and has not assigned it to another party, I will not give that call to another party. This will mean that members who do not wish to speak in the debate will not need to come to the Parliament or to the Chamber to do so. My reason for doing that is to minimise movement to the buildings and within the buildings to those that are absolutely necessary.",31/08/2021 15:01
1785,Speech,Speaker," I've received a letter from the Hon Judith Collins seeking to debate under Standing Order 399 the Government's decision to deploy a C-130 and accompanying personnel to support international efforts to evacuate foreign nationals from Afghanistan and an in principle decision to provide residence to Afghan allies. I have also received a letter from David Seymour seeking to debate the decision of Cabinet to raise the COVID-19 alert levels to level 4 across the country on Tuesday, 17 August in response to community transmission of the Delta variant of COVID-19. Both are particular cases of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. Each matter is significant. However, members have had the opportunity to question Ministers on them following ministerial statements. The applications are therefore declined. In accordance with a determination of the Business Committee, the House stands adjourned until 2 p.m. tomorrow.",31/08/2021 15:50
1786,a,Speaker,,31/08/2021 15:50
1787,Speech,Speaker," Members, yesterday, I indicated that I had received letters from Simon Court and Barbara Kuriger seeking a debate under Standing Order 399 on the widespread power outages on the evening of 9 August. This is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. Confidence in the electricity supply is a very significant matter. There is no other reasonably foreseeable opportunity to debate it, and there appears to me to be matters further to consider beyond the scope of the ministerial statement. Parliament is the place—while not all are matters to do with the electricity sector, some of which are private responsibilities—where it can be debated. It is the place where Ministers are held responsible for the overall system and the particular parts of the system which report to it. So I am going to grant the debate. ",11/08/2021 14:52
1788,a,Speaker,"When I receive two applications for urgent debates on the same matter, preference is given to the application received first. Barbara Kuriger's application was the first received, so I call on her to move that the House take note of a matter of urgent public importance. ",11/08/2021 14:52
1789,Speech,Chairperson," Buckle in, folks, I've got a bit to tell you, OK? Standing Orders provide for 11 hours of debate on the Estimates. There are nine hours and 11 minutes remaining in the debate. The House has given leave to organise the debate by portfolio, so there will be no sector-specific debates. All Votes are available for debate, but only specific Ministers will be available each day, to speak to the indicated portfolios only. So the Government has indicated that—[Interruption] I'll look at you, OK? I'll look at you.",11/08/2021 17:13
1790,a,Chairperson,"The Government has indicated that the Minister for Māori Development, the Minister of Police, and the Minister for Economic and Regional Development will be available today. Each debate will be led by a call from the chairperson or a member of the committee that considered the Estimates most closely related to the Minister's portfolio. The debate expires after 11 hours, at which point questions will be put that the Votes stand part of the schedules and on the provisions of the Appropriation (2021/22 Estimates) Bill.",11/08/2021 17:13
1791,a,Chairperson,"The time in the debate has been allocated to parties on a proportional basis, and may be taken as parties see fit during the debate. New Zealand Labour has four hours 54 minutes remaining. New Zealand National has two hours 46 minutes remaining. The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand has 44 minutes remaining. ACT New Zealand has 47 minutes remaining. Te Paati Māori has eight minutes remaining.",11/08/2021 17:13
1792,a,Chairperson,"The Estimates debate should be relevant to the Government's current spending plans, as contained in the Estimates of Appropriations. A compendium of the reports of select committees on the votes is available on the Table. Finally, I do urge members, when seeking to take a call, to stand up and seek the call. So the question is that the Votes contained in the Estimates of Appropriations for 2021 stand part of the schedules.",11/08/2021 17:13
1793,Speech,Jacinda Ardern, I seek leave to move a motion without notice to congratulate the New Zealand Olympic team.,10/08/2021 14:00
1794,Speech,Speaker, The question is that the motion be agreed to.,10/08/2021 14:06
1795,Speech,Dr Megan Woods," I wish to make a ministerial statement relating to yesterday's power outages. Yesterday, an emergency mechanism in the electricity system was triggered by the system operator, Transpower, requesting network companies direct grid connections to reduce load on their networks. Network companies then took action in response to this request, which saw a number of power outages across the North Island between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. last night. This situation was caused due to insufficient generation being available to meet unprecedented demand on a cold winter's evening across the country.",10/08/2021 14:21
1796,a,Dr Megan Woods,"Yesterday's events unfolded as follows: at 6.43 a.m., Transpower issued a low residual notice to participants following their forecast showing a deficit in generation during the forecast evening peak. Transpower requested more generation or less load. At 1.02 p.m. yesterday, Transpower issued a warning that there was insufficient generation coming in for the evening peak, and another warning was issued at 5.07 p.m. At 6.40 p.m., Transpower issued a request for network companies with direct grid connection to shed load by 1 percent. At 7.10 p.m., Transpower issued a grid emergency notice.",10/08/2021 14:21
1797,a,Dr Megan Woods,"From this timeline, three things have become clear to me: the electricity market had clear warnings about the potential for the shortage situation; secondly, there was inadequate communication with the public about the situation; and, thirdly, there is enough capacity in the system. This led me to write to the large generators asking what action they took in response to Transpower's notice at 6.43 a.m. I also asked them to confirm with officials that they have confidence their companies are doing everything they can to maintain their generating capacity and ensuring security of supply. This is the number one priority for the electricity market. Since my letter this morning, Genesis has explained why it made a commercial decision not to operate one of its plants in response to the forecast shortfall.",10/08/2021 14:21
1798,a,Dr Megan Woods,"Transpower will also apologise for the miscalculation in its demand reduction notice and their communication to the lines companies through the warnings and notices given. I have asked officials to consider what more can be done to better inform the public in the event that a rare grid emergency is likely to occur. I am concerned that the system could not deliver, given there was capacity that could have been brought on, but wasn't.",10/08/2021 14:21
1799,a,Dr Megan Woods,"It is not uncommon for Transpower to issue requests for generators to bring on more generation to meet demand, but it is unusual for an emergency notice to be issued. But let me be clear, regardless of the mechanisms of the electricity market, New Zealanders rightly expect the lights to be on and the heaters to be running on a cold winter's night. That's why the situation that unfolded yesterday was unacceptable. If we're going to have a market-orientated system providing security of supply, then that market must deliver. The market failed in this respect.",10/08/2021 14:21
1800,a,Dr Megan Woods,"This morning I convened an urgent meeting of senior officials from Transpower, the Electricity Authority, and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). I asked a series of questions and sought assurances about the ongoing operations of the market to maintain security of supply. I have also asked that a coordination group be established by MBIE to lead the response and commence a review of what has occurred. While we cannot undo what happened yesterday, we can thoroughly investigate the cause and take steps to minimise the risk of it happening again. I will add that this Government has taken numerous steps towards ensuring the electricity market is working as it should, including a range of responses to recommendations from the electricity price review. The recent spike in high electricity prices as a result of the dry hydrological year and a short-term gas supply issue led me to seek analysis on this from the Electricity Authority. Yesterday's events have prompted further questions on whether the system is fit for purpose.",10/08/2021 14:21
1801,Speech,Speaker," I have received applications for an urgent debate. The Business Committee has determined that a special debate be held on the Dawn Raids after oral questions today. An urgent debate is part of the general business of the House, which takes place in sequence, commencing at 2 p.m. each sitting day. General business takes precedence; so any urgent debate would normally be held before the special debate. However, there is significant public interest and interest in the House in the special debate. Therefore, I seek the leave of the House to consider applications for the urgent debate at the conclusion of the special debate. Is there any objection to that? There appears to be none.",10/08/2021 14:50
1802,Speech,Aupito William Sio," I move, That the House take note of the Dawn Raids and the recent apology. ",10/08/2021 15:51
1803,a,Aupito William Sio,"On 14 June, when the Prime Minister announced that this Government will issue a formal apology to the Pacific communities for the harms, trauma, racism, and prejudice that occurred during the 1970s, we literally opened up the floodgates of a sea of wave after wave after wave of emotion. I, in my role of supporting that announcement, was struggling to try and control my own emotions, because that announcement hit home because it's so personal to me and my family, but my story is one of many stories. I recall Dominic Godfrey on that day also struggled with his emotion, and he was a member of the press gallery. But the emotions have flowed out like a stream and have touched every corner of our Pacific diaspora. It has also touched family members who reside in the Pacific region. It has touched Pacific peoples in other parts of the world, who all recollect now the stories, many of them still emerging.",10/08/2021 15:51
1804,a,Aupito William Sio,"I want to acknowledge, first and foremost, why this is an important story, because it's not just a story for Pacific peoples; it is a New Zealand story. I want to acknowledge the Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, my ministerial colleagues, all of my caucus, the Māori caucus, and, in particular, the Pasifika caucus, because it's been your support that has enabled this apology to take place. I want to say that in order to deliver an apology in a way that is meaningful and that is genuine and that can be accepted by those who were directly impacted, it was important that we used symbolism, culture, throughout the whole story, and there is symbolism from beginning to end. I used symbolism because it is one way in order to convey to those who were hurt directly to understand that we, the Government, and we, the members of Parliament, understand the trauma and the pain, first and foremost.",10/08/2021 15:51
1805,a,Aupito William Sio,"Secondly, I used symbolism to allow the rest of New Zealand who do not understand this story to be receptive to the message that harm was caused and that harm is intergenerational. I wanted to also use symbolism to remind New Zealand of the contribution of Pacific peoples that they have given: the 150 Niueans who performed the war chant; the 500 Cook Islanders who conveyed the pe'e and imene in welcoming the Prime Minister; the Samoans, who have a treaty of friendship—which is another story—who accepted and received the ifoga as a symbol of humility by a head of State. Never before done; usually done when life has been taken. But I believe that this is much, much more—that this is intergenerational. Ask anyone that was directly impacted and affected during that period. Only now, the younger people are beginning to better understand.",10/08/2021 15:51
1806,a,Aupito William Sio,"I used symbolism to paint a picture for those who do not understand culture of Māori or Pasifika, those who do not understand the harms of racism, to recognise the dreadful harm that it causes on a proud, proud people. I used symbolism to try and convey a very strong message to the next generation of Pacific peoples, one of the fastest-growing populations in Aotearoa. A generation that I refer to as the Generation 6Bs—people who are proudly brown, beautiful, brainy, bilingual, and bicultural—only in Māngere, we make it Generation 7Bs by saying they are brilliant. I used symbolism to try and lift their spirits. I used symbolism to try and make them proud of that cultural heritage, a cultural heritage that spreads thousands and thousands of years.",10/08/2021 15:51
1807,a,Aupito William Sio,"Of the elders who took their place, who sat next to the ifoga, one represented those people directly dawn-raided back in those days, and one was Taimalieutu Papali'i Kiwi Tamasese, a descendant of the Mau leaders who were imprisoned by New Zealand in Mt Eden prison, but it was Māui Pōmare, Āpirana Ngata, and Māori here who gave them comfort. I used symbolism through the presence of Falema'i Lesa Sega, a woman who took to court New Zealand and the British Government, all the way through to the Privy Council, to fight for her right to have citizenship. That citizenship she gained, but it got overturned by Muldoon, with the agreement of the Samoan Government at the time.",10/08/2021 15:51
1808,a,Aupito William Sio,"I used symbolism with the presence of Rev. Setaita, who represented the Tongan Methodist Church. The Tongan Methodists in the Tongan community were probably most at harm because police went on the day of worship in their sacred places and pulled people out and took them down to prison. The presence of Father Paulo Iosefa came from the Catholic church down the road, on K Road—the first church in Aotearoa New Zealand to hold mass in the Samoan language. The presence of Rev. Fei Taule'ale'usamai Davis, representing the Pacific Island Church (PIC)—they were the church that brought everybody down the road at the PIC off K Road. That whole K Road was the shopping centre for Pacific peoples in those days, where they could get their produce and meat. Once upon a time, that was a thriving place. Grey Lynn, Kingsland, Avondale—that was where Pacific peoples gravitated to and resided. ",10/08/2021 15:51
1809,a,Aupito William Sio,"I'm grateful to Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, who have offered to help celebrate and commemorate 1 August 2022, the commemoration of this apology. I want to acknowledge Ropota. He is not the usual orator for Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, but he was chosen because he was directly impacted by the Dawn Raids at that period.",10/08/2021 15:51
1810,a,Aupito William Sio,"There are many stories, and I have tried to weave those stories into how this Government delivered that ceremony on that night, because the stories need people to better understand, not by way of compulsion, but by way that they can seek to understand, and understand that Pacific peoples are here to stay in Aotearoa. ",10/08/2021 15:51
1811,a,Aupito William Sio,"As Her Royal Highness Princess Mele Siu'ilikutapu Kalaniuvalu Fotofili said, this is Pacific peoples' home. We are the future of Aotearoa New Zealand, whether others accept it or not. You just need to go around the regions and see the thriving Pacific population from Tai Tokerau to Tai Tonga, from up north to Invercargill, to the east and west of Aotearoa New Zealand. We are a thriving population, but we are being held back when racism and discrimination rears its ugly head, again and again and again, and I'm saying to this House and to all New Zealanders: we have to come together and slam racism on the head. That means that we as leaders of this House also have a duty and responsibility to send strong signals that flow out to all of New Zealand, because, as we say in Samoa, e afua mai mauga fa'amanuiaga o se nu'u. From the mountains flow the blessings that will bless the village, and it is the words that matter, as I said that night, because e i ai la matou fa'aupuga, e pala ma'a ae tumau pea upu. Rocks and boulders all turn to dust, but words matter to us. Words will live for ever through our oratory, through our songs, through our poetry, and we're asking our young people: use the words of that night and display it with pride everywhere they may be.

I must consider whether the subject of the urgent debate warrants setting aside the business of the House today. In light of the time taken on the special debate today, the ministerial statement, and the Olympics motion, I've decided that I will consider the applications tomorrow in the context of business before the House at that time.",10/08/2021 16:49
1815,Speech,Chris Hipkins," I move, That this House approve the following orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020:",10/08/2021 16:50
1816,a,Chris Hipkins,"Under section 16 of the aforementioned Act, any orders that I make under that Act have to be approved by the House or they are revoked. The orders first go to the Regulations Review Committee, who do a very thorough job of examining them to make sure they are consistent with the law, and consistent with good regulatory practice. They've provided feedback to me on various occasions, including some suggestions for improvement that we've taken on board as we have continued to refine those orders. I think it's worth recalling that these orders are being regularly amended. They're being regularly amended for two reasons: one was that they're often put in place quite quickly, and so when you do put orders in place quite quickly, there will be a need to refine them as potential errors or flaws or inconsistencies are identified. The second, though, which is also incredibly important is that the situation around COVID-19 continues to evolve, and, actually, a couple of the orders that we're going to be confirming today really highlight just how much things can evolve and how quickly they can evolve.",10/08/2021 16:50
1817,a,Chris Hipkins,"So to talk through the five orders that this motion confirms, the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order (No 2) Amendment Order (No 2) 2021 makes changes that clarify the isolation requirements for ships coming into the country—a relatively topical thing at the moment, but it makes it very clear what physical distancing means and so on. So when people are coming in on a ship—many of them don't even get off the ship—it makes it very clear how we keep New Zealanders safe in that environment.",10/08/2021 16:50
1818,a,Chris Hipkins,"The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) Amendment Order (No 5) 2021—this was an order that stopped quarantine-free flights from Australia due to a recent community outbreak. Members will note that there is a further order, the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) Amendment Order (No 6) 2021 which restarted quarantine-free flights with Australia. I can confirm that that has subsequently been superseded by another order that we're not confirming yet, because that's currently before the Regulations Review Committee, and that stopped the flights again, which just shows that this is an evolving situation, and these orders, sometimes, by the time we get to confirm them, quite a lot has happened in the intervening period. So we're confirming a stop of the quarantine-free travel, a start of the quarantine-free travel again, and there's another one in the process that will have stopped it.",10/08/2021 16:50
1819,a,Chris Hipkins,"Then we have the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Isolation and Quarantine) Amendment Order 2021. This makes some rules around airline staff, in particular, and clarifies that they don't necessarily have to do the full 14 days of isolation. This is important because we do have different arrangements in place for our aircrew, otherwise we wouldn't be able to operate our airline and other airlines internationally. So this does allow for changes to be made to the requirements around them.",10/08/2021 16:50
1820,a,Chris Hipkins,"COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order (No 8) 2021—this was the order that moved the Wellington region down from alert level 2 back to alert level 1, where the rest of the country was at that time, and Wellington has subsequently remained. So this was the change made after the most recent potential concern that we had here in Wellington.",10/08/2021 16:50
1821,a,Chris Hipkins,"The House is also considering the two reports of the Regulations Review Committee on these and other orders. I want to, again, thank the Regulations Review Committee for the way they have approached dealing with these orders. They have been very diligent and thorough, and, I think, quite pragmatic in the suggestions that they have made. I have, on occasion, consulted the committee, including about some forthcoming legislative changes that we're making, or I've sent them to the committee to have a good look at them before we even bring them to the House, because I think whilst there'll be a lot of politics in COVID-19, I think when it comes to getting the technicalities of the orders and the legislation right, I think there has been a good degree of cooperation across the House on that. I want to thank all of the members who were involved in doing that.",10/08/2021 16:50
1822,a,Chris Hipkins,"So the committee had no concerns around the isolation and quarantine order that I've described, and it had no concerns around the other orders that I've also described. So I thank the committee for their very diligent work.",10/08/2021 16:50
1823,Speech,Chris Hipkins," Thank you, Mr Speaker. I wish to make a ministerial statement relating to the New Zealand Government's decision to suspend quarantine-free travel with Australia.",3/08/2021 14:01
1824,a,Chris Hipkins,"On 22 July, Cabinet met and agreed that the quarantine-free travel from all Australian states and territories would be suspended, based on the Director-General of Health's concern around increased transmissibility of the Delta variant and continued movement of positive cases in the community in New South Wales. Quarantine-free travel with Australia commenced on 19 April, on the basis that travellers from both countries did not have, or were very unlikely to have, COVID-19 spreading through communities.",3/08/2021 14:01
1825,a,Chris Hipkins,"The New Zealand Government adopted a flexible approach of continue and pause with each individual state to give them time to get any COVID-19 infection in their community under control as part of our elimination strategy approach at our border. When we set up the traffic light system for COVID-19, it was based on what we knew at the time about variants that were present and how it was moving through the countries and communities.",3/08/2021 14:01
1826,a,Chris Hipkins,"In the middle of June, the first case of the Bondi cluster was reported in New South Wales. By the middle of July, not only had New Zealand paused quarantine-free travel with New South Wales, but also with Victoria, and then South Australia, due to the risks of COVID-19 in those communities. The Delta variant has materially changed the risk profile of COVID-19. We've seen that contact tracing alone is unable to get ahead of this variant, and that restrictions are absolutely necessary to stamp it out where it emerges.",3/08/2021 14:01
1827,a,Chris Hipkins,"In the view of our health officials, there is now a greater risk from the Delta variant than there was when we opened quarantine-free travel with Australia. It's the New Zealand Government's duty to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19. We continue to believe that the strongest health response is also the strongest economic response. So we made the decision to suspend quarantine-free travel, with a grace period of a week, for New Zealand citizens and those ordinarily resident in New Zealand to return from Australia, with the bubble officially closed for green flights from 11.59 p.m. New Zealand time on Friday, 30 July.",3/08/2021 14:01
1828,a,Chris Hipkins,"Just as we have our alert level settings for managing cases in New Zealand, we also have a framework for managing cases in Australia through the continue, pause, and suspend system. Extra flights have been put on where required—for example, from Brisbane and from Melbourne—and extra capacity was opened up on flights from Perth as people cancelled their existing bookings. Managed return flights will continue as planned from New South Wales, with travellers from that state required to spend 14 days in managed isolation in New Zealand.",3/08/2021 14:01
1829,a,Chris Hipkins,"More than 1,500 rooms in managed isolation have been made available for the first two phases of managed return from New South Wales, and they have accommodated an estimated 2,100 people, including more than 300 urgent and exceptional cases. Last week, the Government confirmed that an additional 500 rooms will be allocated from contingency between 9 and 22 August for those returning from New South Wales. The registration of interest process has been established for these rooms, using a form on the Unite against COVID-19 travel website, which is being used to prioritise those bookings.",3/08/2021 14:01
1830,a,Chris Hipkins,"We remain committed to the trans-Tasman bubble, but it is paramount that it operates in a safe manner. Since we set up quarantine-free travel with Australia back in April, more than 200,000 people have flown between our two countries. In the lead-up to reviewing the suspension with Australia, Ministers will need to be certain that the outbreak with New South Wales and within wider Australia is contained, that any remaining cases are generally linked, and that we don't see a large number of cases in the community.",3/08/2021 14:01
1831,a,Chris Hipkins,"Our team of 5 million here in New Zealand has worked hard to put us in a strong position, both health-wise and economically, and we do not want to put these hard-won gains at risk. We'll continue to adapt, improve, and learn in the Government's response to COVID-19 as we need to, to meet the challenges presented by new variants and to keep New Zealand safe. Globally, we're seeing the consequences of not doing that.",3/08/2021 14:01
1832,Speech,Speaker," I have received a letter from David Seymour seeking to debate under Standing Order 399 the actions and comments of the Minister of Education regarding special needs education in public schools. This is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. Having considered the matters raised by the member in his letter, I'm not convinced that it reached the threshold that warrants setting aside the business of the House, particularly given the fact that we're about to commence the Estimates debate. The application is therefore declined.",3/08/2021 15:32

1834,Speech,Chairperson," Kia orana tatou kātoatoa. Members, the House is in committee for consideration of the Appropriation (2021/22 Estimates) Bill. The Standing Orders provide for 11 hours of debate on the Estimates. The House has given leave to organise the debates by portfolio so there will be no set specific debates. All Votes are available for debate, but only specific Ministers will be available each day to speak to their indicated portfolios only. The Government has indicated that the Minister for the Environment and for Oceans and Fisheries, the Minister of Energy and Resources, and the Minister of Health will be available today. Each debate will be led by a call from the chairperson or member of the committee that considered the Estimates most closely related to the Minister's portfolios.",3/08/2021 15:33

1839,Speech,Chris Hipkins," Thank you, Mr Speaker. I move, That the following sessional order be adopted: A leader of Te Paati Māori is entitled to one 20-minute call in the Budget debate, one 20-minute call in the debate on the Prime Minister's statement, and a five-minute call on any ministerial statement, and Standing Order 365 and Appendix A are to be applied accordingly.",1/07/2021 14:59

1841,Interjection,Speaker," Order! Order! Both sides, please.",1/07/2021 14:59
1842,ContinueSpeech,Chris Hipkins," There were reasons why that particular provision was introduced some time ago, particularly in the introduction of MMP, when a number of MPs were moving around parties and there was a need for some certainty. In this Parliament, it has created an anomaly, in that it's excluded just one party from being able to contribute on those occasions. This motion evens out that anomaly by granting Te Paati Māori the right to have a call on ministerial statements and for one of its co-leaders to have a call of 20 minutes in the Budget debate and the debate on the Prime Minister's statement. That brings them into line with the other parties in Parliament in terms of that entitlement. This sessional order will apply for the rest of this Parliament, and, as part of its triannual review, the Standing Orders Committee can assess whether the current rules about speaking rights for parties of varying sizes are appropriate for the longer term.",1/07/2021 14:59
1843,a,Chris Hipkins,"I would note that we have done similar things in the past, where smaller parties have had only one or two members. Similar provisions were in place in the last Parliament to allow the ACT Party leader, who at that point was a sole MP, to be able to participate in debates, and, if I recall correctly, similar provisions existed prior to allow the ACT Party, United Future Party, and, in fact, the Māori Party, when it had fewer members, to also be able to participate in those debates.",1/07/2021 14:59
1844,Speech,Golriz Ghahraman," Point of order.

1853,Speech,Chris Hipkins, I wish to make a ministerial statement following Cabinet decisions on the alert level in the Wellington region and the travel pause with Australia.,1899-12-30 14:00:59
1854,a,Chris Hipkins,"We've been at alert level 2 in Wellington for the past week out of an abundance of caution given the large number of highly populated places a recent case visited while potentially infectious with the Delta variant of COVID-19. Given there have been no cases of COVID-19 detected, nearly 2,500 negative results from potential contacts of the case—including repeat negative results from that person's close contacts—Cabinet has decided to shift Wellington to alert level 1 from 11.59 p.m. tonight. We are confident that the risk of community transmission from that case is low, but I ask all New Zealanders to remain vigilant and stay on high alert until a full 14 days have passed since that Sydney case left New Zealand. Testing centres will remain open in Wellington central, Porirua, Kāpiti coast, Hutt Valley, and the Wairarapa. People who haven't checked locations of interest should do so, and get a test if they have been to any of those locations within the specified time period; or if they have cold and flu symptoms, any aches or pains, they should stay home, they should call Healthline or their GP, and they should arrange to get a test.",1899-12-30 14:00:59
1855,a,Chris Hipkins,"Cabinet's also agreed to extend the travel pause on trans-Tasman travel for most Australian states. From 11.59 p.m. on Sunday, 4 July, New Zealand will lift the travel pause to allow travel to and from South Australia, ACT, Tasmania, and Victoria. That will be under review until that time. The health advice is that the spread of COVID-19 cases in those parts of Australia has been contained at this point. There's robust surveillance testing and contact tracing to detect and manage cases and adequate border controls are in place to prevent the spread of new cases. Officials will keep a close eye on the situation in these states. However, Cabinet has decided to extend requirements for people coming to New Zealand to include a pre-departure test. This means that all travellers eligible to fly to New Zealand will now be required to have a pre-departure test within 72 hours of when they are leaving Australia. To be eligible to fly, travellers must not have been in Queensland, the Northern Territory, or Western Australia on or after 10.30 p.m. New Zealand time on 26 June and they must not have been in New South Wales on or after 11.59 p.m. New Zealand time on 22 June.",1899-12-30 14:00:59
1856,a,Chris Hipkins,"We want to ensure that New Zealanders aren't unnecessarily barred from travelling to New Zealand when there is no risk of COVID-19, but we do need to keep monitoring the situation closely. Cabinet carefully weighed up the evidence this morning and we consider a partial lifting of the pause to be a proportionate action when that's also bolstered by the introduction of mandatory pre-departure testing. Today's decision gives airlines, passengers, Government officials, and others time to prepare for flights back from those states that we consider to be low risk when that travel pause lifts. ",1899-12-30 14:00:59
1857,a,Chris Hipkins,We know how important the travel bubble is—in particular for families and for businesses—but we also want to avoid the situation where we have to respond to cases here in New Zealand. Our system from here of only opening up to states as and when they bring COVID-19 under control will help New Zealand to stay at COVID-19 alert level 1.,1899-12-30 14:00:59

The additional time that that accords by allowing the committee to call for submissions immediately and start getting its briefing from departmental officials I'm sure will be appreciated by the committee.",29/06/2021 20:09
1870,a,David Parker,"I'm not going to go into a lot of detail, but I think there's general agreement across the House that the Resource Management Act (RMA) has passed its use-by date and hasn't really achieved the purpose, which was to protect the environment and enable development. In truth, processes take too long, they cost too much, and it hasn't been successful at protecting the environment against cumulative effects. The RMA's theory was that we would avoid, remedy, or mitigate adverse effects—in the end it's generally been ""mitigate"" rather than ""avoid"". As a consequence, environmental services have been sliced off like a salami having a slice taken off time and again. That's the reason why we've had degrading water quality, and it's also failed in its role, really, in respect of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to that, it obviously hasn't enabled enough housing supply to keep up with the demand for housing, and that's not the only reason why we have a housing crisis in New Zealand, but it has contributed to it. ",29/06/2021 20:09
1871,a,David Parker,"The new legislation moves or proposes to move to an outcomes focus rather than an effects basis, and those outcomes are to be specified in the national planning framework, which is explained in the explanatory note that's going to the select committee. That will include bottom lines on things like water quality. But, for the first time, it will also have positive prescriptions in there to require positive outcomes for infrastructure development and housing. Although there is some provision in respect of housing in the current National Policy Statement on Urban Development, there will be a more holistic view to this. It works in combination with the proposed Strategic Planning Act, which will provide high-level strategic planning by region. The number of plans will chunk down from around 100 to about 14. We say ""about"" because we're not quite finalised as to what we're going to do in the north of the South Island, where there are a couple of unitary authorities. But, essentially, it will reduce the number of plans from 100 to 14, which is an enormous reduction. ",29/06/2021 20:09

All of this happened through the difficulty of COVID-19, and that makes this achievement all the more remarkable.",24/06/2021 14:00

In Mount Maunganui over the summer, fast bowler Neil Wagner bowled over after over, with not one but two broken toes, while driving New Zealand to victory over Pakistan.

I have had the privilege to spend time with the Black Caps over the last few years, and they have a team culture that exemplifies the very best of Aotearoa New Zealand. They are frequently cited by other teams and commentators as playing cricket as it should be played—playing hard but always playing in a spirit of fairness, respect, and camaraderie. The team are humble, authentic, and deeply loyal to one another and to New Zealand.",24/06/2021 14:00

1884,a,Grant Robertson,"In conclusion, I want to say that I was at Lord's two years ago with a number of other members of the House when New Zealand did not win the one-day international World Cup. I say ""did not win"" because I am pretty sure that they did not lose either. That was a heartbreaking day for cricket fans, but obviously much more so for the players. Seven of those players were in the team today.",24/06/2021 14:00

As the chair of the select committee, I thought it might benefit the House for me to show how we came about this report and speak on the process that we went through and, as well, the findings of our report.",24/06/2021 15:05
1889,a,Marja Lubeck,"In 2020, the Education and Workforce Committee for the 52nd Parliament opened an inquiry into student accommodation because it wanted to learn more about students' experiences and recommend what could be done to improve the systems and processes associated with student accommodation. The terms of reference for the inquiry, while we centred them around the student experience, were kept broad to allow the committee to investigate the range of issues and concerns raised through submissions, but also as a means of starting a dialogue between all the parties and how we could raise the standard of student accommodation in New Zealand. We wanted to learn more about how student accommodation providers were performing in regards to pastoral care, transparency of decision making, and cultural competency, as well as the role of those servicing student accommodation, particularly for residential assistants (RAs), who tend to live on site and provide ongoing pastoral care to their residents.",24/06/2021 15:05
1890,a,Marja Lubeck,"This inquiry was also designed to help inform the development of a pastoral care code by the Government. There is an interim code at the moment, which was introduced by the Minister of Education, the Hon Chris Hipkins. This interim code, which was supported by all parties, was introduced following the tragic death of Mason Pendrous in 2019, whilst living in student accommodation. Following the establishment of the current 53rd Parliament, our select committee re-adopted the inquiry and received 148 submissions and heard 30 oral submissions, including a variety of students, student associations, owners and operators of student accommodation, and tertiary education providers.",24/06/2021 15:05
1891,a,Marja Lubeck,"During this time, the Government was continuing its work on developing the new code of pastoral care. This will set out the expectations that tertiary organisations and accommodation providers must meet for student wellbeing and safety. Our terms of reference guided our work on this inquiry, and after listening to all the submitters, the committee's conclusions fell into four main themes. We therefore structured our report according to these areas of the student accommodation system which seemed to be most in need of improvement.",24/06/2021 15:05
1892,a,Marja Lubeck,"So if I then start with the first area: we heard concerns around the transparency and accountability of the governance structures present within student accommodation. Submitters told us that finding this information can be difficult and that can then lead to a lack of understanding around who is responsible for what particular decision making. We heard from the submitters that this has practical implications, as a student may not be able to identify the appropriate point of contact for an issue they're having and how they can resolve that issue. The Tertiary Education Union told us, for example, that due to a lack of clear and accessible information pertaining to complaints processes, policies, and governance structures, it is currently difficult for learners in student accommodation to seek adequate assistance in instances where conflict resolution is required.",24/06/2021 15:05
1893,a,Marja Lubeck,"Now, this particular issue of dispute resolution was then our second theme in our findings. We heard from students and student associations that more needed to be done to support students through the process and that some students had an apprehension about raising an issue as they felt they could potentially risk losing their home. Dr Myra Williamson spoke to this power imbalance in her submission, and she compared it to a line from the Eagles' ""Hotel California"": ""You can check out any time you like but you can never leave."" And I believe that this may be the first time ever that the Eagles were referenced in a submission.",24/06/2021 15:05
1894,a,Marja Lubeck,"Submitters gave us many suggestions on how the student voice could be brought into the decision making and how information can be appropriately disseminated to enable full participation in that particular decision making. Our report recommended that student accommodation providers be required to practise the details and the outcomes outlined in the proposed education code of practice 2021. These would provide for students to be engaged in the decision making at a level where they are empowered through access to information and with access to a more strongly connected internal complaints process, the New Zealand Qualifications Authority complaints process, and the dispute resolution scheme in a proposed code of practice. ",24/06/2021 15:05
1895,a,Marja Lubeck,"We also investigated how wellbeing and safety of staff in student accommodation was handled. In that particular regard, I want to make a mention of the high level of professionalism that there is amongst student accommodation staff. We know that accommodation staff across the board work hard and are dedicated to meeting residents' needs and ensuring residents in student accommodation have a positive experience. Student accommodation is increasingly becoming a professional career path, and through the inquiry, the committee heard from current and former staff who have been working in this sector for a long time and have a wealth of experience. In addition to the long-term accommodation, staff are residential assistants. These roles are filled year on year by senior students and play a key part in a wider student accommodation staff support provided to residents, including, for example, initial residential support and response in identifying situations for follow-up escalation. ",24/06/2021 15:05
1896,a,Marja Lubeck,"The committee welcomed the focus of the proposed code of practice on wellbeing and support and recommended that ongoing training should be provided to accommodation staff, including RAs, so they can perform their roles more effectively and raise the standard of the training that is provided.",24/06/2021 15:05
1897,a,Marja Lubeck,"Many submitters told us, including the New Zealand Union of Students' Association, about specific areas they believe the training should include, from understanding of the Tiriti, diversity and cultural competency, physical and sexual violence prevention, and responding to mental health issues and suicide prevention. It became clear, hearing the submissions, that there was a great variety in the number of residential assistants, training, timing of training, and also expectations on them in the role. But although accommodation staff play a vital role in supporting residents' wellbeing and safety in student accommodation, it's important to remember that they are not the silver bullet. Accommodation staff sit amongst a wider support network available to residents, including support provided through the tertiary education provider. ",24/06/2021 15:05
1898,a,Marja Lubeck,"So I spoke about four themes—so then I get to the final, fourth, theme, which is the emergency preparedness of tertiary education providers and their response to COVID-19. When New Zealand went into a lockdown to prepare for COVID-19 and stop the spread, the students, education providers, and accommodation providers faced uncertainty, and that led to inconsistency in the level of support and information provided to students. ",24/06/2021 15:05
1899,a,Marja Lubeck,"We noticed that there is work being done in the proposed code to outline expectations on accommodation providers in terms of emergency response planning, guidance given to residents in an emergency situation, and on the reasonableness of accommodation providers' refund policies, because we heard from many students about financial insecurity and they felt it was unfair that they had to pay their fees living off premises during the lockdown. So we endorse those expectations and we look forward to seeing how these submissions will inform the ongoing work that the Government is doing.",24/06/2021 15:05
1900,a,Marja Lubeck,"I really enjoyed working on this inquiry. All members of our select committee worked really collegially, and we look forward to the Government's response by early August of this year. ",24/06/2021 15:05
1901,a,Marja Lubeck,"I would like to thank everybody who made a submission during this process—the experiences that people shared with us, all of their stories. They have significantly contributed to the work and the recommendations that we subsequently made to the Government. The stories that we're told will inform the next steps that this Government is taking, what we're doing on the new pastoral care code of practice, and the dispute resolution scheme. That particular work will be informed by all of the stories and submissions that we heard.",24/06/2021 15:05
1902,a,Marja Lubeck,"I would also like to thank the officials, the advisers, and our fantastic Office of the Clerk team that supported our select committee through this particular work.",24/06/2021 15:05
1903,a,Marja Lubeck,"I'd like to thank my committee members, who all took part in this inquiry, for their collegial stance during the whole inquiry, so that's Camilla Belich, Paul Goldsmith, Jan Logie, Jo Luxton, Ibrahim Omer, Angela Roberts, Erica Stanford, and Chris Baillie. Jamie Strange and Penny Simmonds get a special mention for taking part in the latter part of the inquiry. And, of course, it would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge Chlöe Swarbrick, who was the Greens spokesperson on tertiary education at the start of the inquiry and she continued to play an important part during the inquiry in this term of our 53rd Parliament. Thank you, Madam Speaker.",24/06/2021 15:05
1904,Speech,Chris Hipkins," I wish to make a ministerial statement. Just over an hour ago, Cabinet met and decided, out of an abundance of caution, to move to alert level 2 in the greater Wellington region, which includes the Wairarapa and the Kāpiti Coast, from 6 p.m. tonight to 11.59 p.m. on Sunday. The rest of New Zealand remains at COVID-19 alert level 1. This follows the positive COVID-19 test for the traveller from Sydney who was in Wellington over the weekend. These settings will be reviewed by Cabinet again on Sunday.",23/06/2021 14:00
1905,a,Chris Hipkins,"This is the first time that we have moved up to alert level 2 to manage the potential risk of COVID-19 in the community. This is not a lockdown. If we all contribute and follow the health behaviours at alert level 2, we can break any potential transmission. I would reiterate that these are precautionary measures that will remain in place while we contact trace and test all of those who we need to. First and foremost, we want to ensure that New Zealanders are not unnecessarily exposed to COVID-19. We have always had a plan for a situation like this. Our contact tracers are currently working at pace, and they have been since we were first notified of this case last night.",23/06/2021 14:00
1906,a,Chris Hipkins,"The positive case, who is back in Sydney, was being spoken to until well after most people here in New Zealand had already gone to bed, and again early this morning. The person's four close contacts in New Zealand were notified last night. They were put into self-isolation and they were tested first thing this morning. Two of those results have come back; they were negative. I was advised on the way to the House that the remaining two have also come back and they have also been negative. Locations of interest were identified, published, and updated as more information has come to light throughout the day. We continue to work closely with the case and close contacts to ensure that we've got all of the information we need for a swift response.",23/06/2021 14:00
1907,a,Chris Hipkins,"The decision follows the pause in quarantine-free travel with New South Wales. The decision to do that was made at around 5 o'clock last night. To be clear: that decision was taken before we were notified of the current positive case from the person who had been in Wellington. We've taken a deliberately cautious approach to pausing travel when there is community transmission in Australia, and that continues. Where cases cannot be linked to the border, or there are unanswered questions as to their origin, we will consider a pause. That is what we have done again in this case.",23/06/2021 14:00
1908,a,Chris Hipkins,"A reminder about what alert level 2 means for Wellington: it means that gatherings of more than 100 people should not take place. We know that gatherings pose the biggest risk of spread—this includes weddings, birthdays, funerals, tangi, and church services. Social distancing measures should be observed: 2 metres in public places and in retail stores, like supermarkets and clothes shops, and at least 1 metre in most other places, such as workplaces, cafes, restaurants, and gyms. The wearing of face masks remains compulsory on all public transport, and I also encourage people to wear them when they are waiting for public transport or are in taxis and ride-share services. I'd also encourage people to wear a face covering in any situation where physical distancing is not possible. Businesses can open but they need to follow public health rules, including ensuring physical distancing, record keeping, and the cap of 100 people. Schools and early childhood services also stay open at alert level 2. Hospitality venues must apply the three S's: seated, separated, and single server. ",23/06/2021 14:00
1909,a,Chris Hipkins,"The message remains: if you are sick, please stay home; don't go to work or school and don't socialise. If you've got symptoms of a cold or flu, or aches and pains, call your doctor or Healthline and ask about being tested. Please keep track of where you have been at all times. This is a reminder of the importance of our COVID Tracer app and maintaining accurate records of one's movements. While travel is not restricted under alert level 2, people should be encouraged, and are encouraged, to take their behaviours and take their alert level with them when they are outside of the Wellington region—so, for example, if someone was in Wellington over the weekend and they are now in Christchurch, please do not attend large gatherings. This will help for us all to keep each other safe.",23/06/2021 14:00
1910,Speech,Speaker," I have received a letter from David Seymour seeking to debate under Standing Order 399 the decision of Cabinet to raise the COVID-19 alert level to level 2 in Wellington. This is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. Although the application was lodged after 1 p.m., the event to which it relates occurred after that time, so according to Speaker's ruling 199/2 the application can be accepted. A ministerial statement has been made on the change in alert levels. Members have had the opportunity to discuss the matter today. I'm sorry; I'm deliberately doing this quite slowly to see if the member's here. There is an opportunity for this matter to be considered as part of the general debate, and therefore I don't think that further time should be set aside on this matter today, and therefore I decline the application.",23/06/2021 15:28
1911,Interjection,Chris Hipkins," Just as well for you, David.",23/06/2021 15:28
1912,ContinueSpeech,Speaker," Well, I was going to say it was pretty close. ",23/06/2021 15:28
1913,Speech,Speaker," Members, it has been drawn to my attention that a recent decision of the High Court raises a general matter of privilege that requires further examination. This matter has not been raised by a complaint from a member, but it is my opinion that the subject is sufficiently important enough to exercise my authority under Standing Order 414. The decision in Staples v Freeman [2021] NZHC 1308, dated 4 June 2021, relates to an action for defamation and substantively considers a speech made in the House on 23 July 2014. The issue for consideration by the Privileges Committee is whether the court's treatment of the member's speech in its determination of the action for defamation compromises the House's privilege of free speech as described in the Parliamentary Privilege Act 2014 and in article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688. The Privileges Committee is the body that the House has established to investigate such matters. It has the power to hear evidence and to formulate recommendations for the House that will provide guidance for the future.",22/06/2021 14:03
1914,Speech,Speaker," I've received a letter from the Hon Eugenie Sage and Chlöe Swarbrick seeking to debate under Standing Order 399 the release by the Government of Revitalising the Gulf—Government action on the Sea Change Plan. This is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. The test for whether a matter requires the immediate attention of the House is a high one. The matter is, undoubtedly, an important one. The strategy is to be implemented over time, and there will be further opportunities to debate the success of each element of it. Implementing parts of the strategy requires legislation. While the application comes close, it does not have a sufficient element of urgency to warrant setting aside the business of the House today. The application is therefore declined. It could, however, be the subject of an application to the Business Committee for a special debate.",22/06/2021 15:05
1915,Speech,James Shaw," I wish to make a ministerial statement relating to the release of the Climate Change Commission's report, Ināia tonu nei: a low emissions future for Aotearoa. ",9/06/2021 14:02
1916,Interjection,Speaker, Just keep going.,9/06/2021 14:02
1917,ContinueSpeech,James Shaw," Thank you, Mr Speaker. Earlier today, I tabled the advice in Parliament that the Government has received from the politically independent, science-led Climate Change Commission on the total amount of global warming pollution Aotearoa New Zealand must cut over the next 15 years. The commission's advice also provides an achievable, affordable, and technologically feasible blueprint for achieving this. As members read through the advice in the coming days and weeks, there are four main points to keep in mind. They are that addressing the climate crisis is achievable, it is affordable, it offers huge opportunities for improved wellbeing and innovation, and that it must be planned in a fair and equitable way and honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi. ",9/06/2021 14:02
1918,a,James Shaw,"Starting with the targets themselves, I'd like to take each of these in turn. The Climate Change Commission says that our climate change targets are achievable and can be met with existing technology, but only if we act now. Over the last 3½ years, this Government has laid the foundations from which the commission is now asking us to build. This will help to ensure a sustained decline in the pollution that we put into the atmosphere, and it will mean future Governments can ensure that this decline continues and, in fact, picks up pace every year until we hit net zero. ",9/06/2021 14:02
1919,a,James Shaw,"The commission is also clear that taking the action required of us is affordable. According to the world's leading scientists, we must cut global emissions in half by 2030 to have any chance of staying within the 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming threshold. That is now less than nine years away. If we delay action for another year, that drops to eight, but the size of the effort doesn't get any smaller. We still have to cut the same amount of pollution, whether we do it in seven years or eight or nine, if we start today. Every year of delay makes the effort harder and more expensive than if we just get on with it right now. Those calling for delay, as they always do, are in fact calling for higher costs and greater economic disruption than is necessary, and the commission makes that clear. It predicts that delaying action would cost us 2.3 percent of GDP—almost double the cost to our economy of acting now. ",9/06/2021 14:02
1920,a,James Shaw,"The third point is to draw members' attention to the opportunities within our grasp. A zero-carbon economy will create cleaner, more vibrant, and healthier communities in every part of our economy. It will connect our towns and cities with frequent and fast trains and buses, and roads freer of congestion. It will create green jobs that pay people enough to provide for their families and put a roof over their heads. It will support innovation, new business opportunities, and new investment in clean-tech, high-value industries. It will benefit people's health because of warmer, drier homes, more walking and cycling, and less air pollution. When the commission released its draft advice in January, I said that I had never felt more confident that a climate-friendly, healthy, and prosperous future for New Zealand was within reach, and I still feel the same today. ",9/06/2021 14:02
1921,a,James Shaw,"Finally, though the commission's advice makes clear the overall benefit to New Zealand of the transition to a lower-emissions future, it does say that the impacts will not necessarily be evenly felt. There will be people up and down the country wondering what the transition means for their families and for their livelihoods. On this, the commission presses upon the Government the need to plan our transition in a fair, equitable, and inclusive way. This includes working in partnership with iwi Māori and local communities, and signalling policies well in advance to give everyone time to plan. ",9/06/2021 14:02
1922,a,James Shaw,"The first chance the Government will have to show that we are equal to the challenge that the Climate Change Commission has set us will come with the setting of the first three emissions budgets and the emissions reduction plan. This plan will need to include policies and strategies that cut across every sector of the economy, including agriculture and forestry, transport, building and construction, waste and heat industry, and power. It will also look at the changes needed across the finance system, infrastructure, and planning and emissions pricing. ",9/06/2021 14:02
1923,a,James Shaw,"We will consult on the plan and there will be opportunities for members to consider the emissions budgets. In doing so, I hope that they will take heed of the commission's point that some issues are too big for politics and, in turn, the calls for cross-party consensus from business and local communities. ",9/06/2021 14:02
1924,a,James Shaw,"To close, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank the commission for their hard work, their analytical honesty, and their rigour. What they have achieved with their advice will have a lasting impact on the type of planet that our children inherit from us. Nō reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa. ",9/06/2021 14:02

He was Minister for the Environment, Minister of Science and Technology, and Minister of Broadcasting from 1981 to 1984. I desire, on behalf of this House, to express our sense of the loss we have sustained and our sympathy with the relatives of the late former member.

1929,Speech,Grant Robertson," Today I want to give an update to the House on the situation in Canterbury after the weather event and what the Government is doing to assist local communities in response and recovery. This has been a really tough time for the people of South, Mid, and North Canterbury, and I want to acknowledge how disruptive and distressing this flooding has been for the people impacted by this weather event. I'd like to recognise the extraordinary efforts of emergency management staff, first responders, volunteers, Ngāi Tahu, the Rural Support Trust, and community and rural leaders across the region.",1/06/2021 14:01
1930,a,Grant Robertson,"A state of local emergency was declared on Sunday afternoon and remains in place for the region. Numerous roads and bridges have been damaged by floodwater, and rail lines are closed between Arthur's Pass and Christchurch, Pines Beach and Christchurch, and Timaru and Christchurch. Over 100 people have been evacuated across the region, including 16 retirement village residents from Geraldine. The tremendous efforts of everyone involved in the response means this event has, thankfully, not resulted in any loss of human life.",1/06/2021 14:01
1931,a,Grant Robertson,"The Government is committed to helping the region through its response and recovery to this event. We have already announced funding through the mayoral relief fund of $100,000. This will support those impacted by the heavy rain event in the region, and as the rain begins to ease and rivers begin to fall, rapid assessments will be needed to ensure that bridges and households are safe. The Prime Minister, and Minister of Agriculture, and the Acting Minister for Emergency Management have visited the region and surveyed the damage. We continue to be heartened to see community members showing such great support for one another. Many evacuated residents are staying with family and friends, and marae have played a valuable role by opening their doors to those who have needed support.",1/06/2021 14:01
1932,a,Grant Robertson,"Earlier this afternoon, the Minister of Agriculture, the Hon Damien O'Connor, declared a medium-level adverse event for the Canterbury region. Classifying the events as such will ensure funding of $500,000 for flood recovery measures, and it signals the Government's ongoing commitment to support those impacted as they start to recover.",1/06/2021 14:01
1933,a,Grant Robertson,"In addition, the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) is able to approve up to $500,000 per event for the use of Enhanced Taskforce Green to help with clean-up and recovery efforts following an adverse event. Enhanced Taskforce Green can provide funding to employ job seekers to assist with the clean-up and can also be used to hire or purchase equipment and clothing needed for Ministry of Social Development clients to undertake the clean-up.",1/06/2021 14:01
1934,a,Grant Robertson,"As the floodwaters recede and the scale of clean-up activities becomes clearer, MSD will be better able to understand the requirements needed and the needs assessments that are completed. The response has been extremely well managed at a local and regional level. The Canterbury region Civil Defence Emergency Management group has been leading response efforts. The National Emergency Management Agency National Coordination Centre has also been activated in support of the response. Local emergency personnel have been providing strong and welcomed assistance to the impacted communities. Police and Fire and Emergency New Zealand have assisted in a variety of capacities as required, and I also want to acknowledge the New Zealand Army, who have provided 16 vehicles and 30 personnel across the region, and two helicopters have been made available as well. St John Ambulance has deployed resources to Ashburton and Timaru.",1/06/2021 14:01
1935,a,Grant Robertson,"Local rural support trusts, Federated Farmers, the Ministry for Primary Industries, and other rural agencies are also providing support as impacts on the rural sector can be properly assessed. Welfare services are available to help people with their needs. Coordinating people during emergencies is challenging, but it is taken in its stride and we thank those people for their work. Welfare is being delivered across the region and, again, local marae are supporting here.",1/06/2021 14:01
1936,a,Grant Robertson,"The Government is strongly committed to supporting the Canterbury region as it recovers from this significant flooding event.

The Budget is set to continue today, with 6½ hours remaining, and it provides an opportunity to debate this issue. The application is therefore declined. I will say, however, that this application was well framed and if it wasn't for the Budget debate, I would have granted the application.",1/06/2021 14:53

1939,a,Grant Robertson,"It is an honour and a privilege to present the Wellbeing Budget 2021—Securing Our Recovery to the House. Today's Budget is set against the backdrop of two previous Budgets, one delivered last year and one that was delivered 30 years ago. Budget 2020 was very much a COVID-19 Budget that provided the largest ever fiscal stimulus to support New Zealanders through the shock and impact of the global pandemic, and while the economy has outperformed predictions, the job is not yet done. This year's Budget is still in the shadow of COVID-19, and its focus is to secure our recovery from its impact. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1940,a,Grant Robertson,"This Budget is also set against the Budget delivered 30 years ago this year, the so-called ""mother of all Budgets"". It was the Budget that finalised the benefit cuts, which introduced the idea of hospitals being replaced by Crown health enterprises, that set in motion interest-bearing student loans, and that welcomed the passing of the Employment Contracts Act. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1941,a,Grant Robertson,"On the 30th anniversary of that Budget, our Government is undoing some of the damage done all those decades ago. In recent weeks, we've released the details of fair pay agreements to lift wages and conditions across the industries where some of our lowest-paid people work, and, today, we address the most inequitable of the changes made 30 years ago. We restore dignity and hope for those lowest-income New Zealanders by righting the wrong of those benefit cuts and by boosting main benefits by up to $55 per week. This not only continues our quest to reduce inequality; it also acts as further support and stimulus to our economy as we recover from COVID-19. I will return to the detail of this shortly, but it is to the economic impact of COVID-19 that I wish to turn first. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1942,a,Grant Robertson,"A great deal has happened since I stood in this Chamber, socially distanced, a year ago to deliver Budget 2020. Unemployment was forecast to peak at close to 10 percent; the Treasury had cut $100 billion out of its pre-COVID GDP forecast, with many economists saying it would take at least until 2023 for activity to return to previous levels. Government revenue was forecast to be lower than 2019 levels for nearly three years. The OBEGAL deficit was predicted to be at nearly $30 billion from 2020 to 2022, and our net debt was forecast to rise to near 55 percent of GDP in 2023. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1943,a,Grant Robertson,"In the face of this one-in-100-year shock, the New Zealand economy has proved to be remarkably resilient. Today's Budget shows that the New Zealand economy is expected to build on this resilience as we secure our recovery. Unemployment is forecast to go back to 4.2 percent, and an extra 221,000 people will enter employment over the next four years. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1944,a,Grant Robertson,"GDP growth will rise from 2.9 percent this year to 4.4 percent in 2023. Exports are forecast to grow, on average, by 5.8 percent over the next four years. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1945,a,Grant Robertson,"Business investment is forecast to grow at nearly 6 percent a year. Wage growth, at nearly 3 percent a year, will outpace inflation, meaning more money in Kiwis' back pockets. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1946,a,Grant Robertson,"Our stronger economy also means stronger Government books. Crown tax revenue is forecast to have fallen by only 1.6 percent between 2020 and 2021. The OBEGAL deficit in the current 2021 financial year is forecast to be about half of what was predicted a year ago. The operating balance and residual cash are forecast to be in surplus at the end of the forecast period, while the OBEGAL is projected to be in surplus from 2026-27—roughly the same time the previous Government took to get to surplus following the global financial crisis. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1947,a,Grant Robertson,"At no point now is net debt forecast to go above 50 percent of GDP. While the headline numbers show a peak of 48 percent, looking through the impact of the Reserve Bank's Funding for Lending programme, net debt is forecast to be 41.4 percent in 2025. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1948,a,Grant Robertson,"New Zealanders can be proud of our response to COVID-19. It's been recognised around the world as not only a successful, science-driven public health response but also as a strong economic response. In February, Standard & Poor's global ratings gave New Zealand the first credit ratings upgrade of any sovereign since the pandemic, and the first for New Zealand since 2003. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1949,a,Grant Robertson,"I acknowledge that our stronger economic position will mean that there are people who argue we should be taking on more debt and running larger deficits than we present here today. There will also be people who argue we should be reducing debt faster, cutting Government services, and removing our support for the economy, even as the global pandemic continues to rage. I believe Budget 2021 gets the balance right. It protects New Zealand's strong position by keeping a lid on debt and tracking a responsible return towards surplus while also giving us the ability to make targeted investments where they are needed most to secure our recovery. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1950,a,Grant Robertson,"This balanced approach is needed because, despite our success, the impact of COVID-19 is still very much present. The images of death and distress from India, the outbreaks in our own region in Fiji, the emergence of new variants, and the slow return to normality elsewhere are stark reminders that we are not through this. Every economic forecast, no matter how positive, is accompanied by frequent use of the words ""uncertainty"" and ""volatility"". ",20/05/2021 14:04
1951,a,Grant Robertson,"At home, we have seen the impact of COVID-19 fall unevenly. Sectors such as tourism, international education, hospitality, and events have taken a hit, and regions reliant on them are struggling. The impact has also been disproportionate on groups within our society, with women, Māori, and Pacific peoples' unemployment rising disproportionately during the worst of COVID-19. In the face of uncertainty and the ongoing impact of COVID-19, the Government needs to continue to support and stimulate the economy in order to secure our recovery. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1952,a,Grant Robertson,"New Zealanders' wellbeing has held up relatively well during COVID-19. The Wellbeing Outlook released by the Government today shows life satisfaction has remained high during the pandemic, with 86 percent of respondents to the March wellbeing supplement of the household labour force survey reporting high satisfaction—the same as in December 2020, and slightly higher than in September and June 2020. In fact, life satisfaction levels reported across the past year during COVID-19 have actually remained higher than in the 2018 general social survey. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1953,a,Grant Robertson,"The data, however, does show the groups of New Zealanders with lower levels of wellbeing. Sole parents, unemployed people, and people not in the labour force due to injury, sickness, or disability are more likely to report lower life satisfaction and that they have felt lonely most or all of the time. Māori and Pacific people are also more likely to report fair or poor health and continue to face barriers to education. This data reinforces the importance of our wellbeing objectives. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1954,a,Grant Robertson,"As in the last two Budgets, our investments are in line with wellbeing objectives based on evidence, data, and advice from experts. The objectives are: making a just transition to a low-carbon economy, ensuring everyone benefits from the future of work, enhancing Māori and Pacific opportunities, improving child wellbeing, and a focus on mental and physical health. These objectives are enduring and require sustained investment in order to be met. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1955,a,Grant Robertson,"The initiatives in this year's Budget were again subject to a wellbeing analysis, which includes assessment against these objectives, the domains of the Living Standards Framework, implementation readiness, and value for money. We are continuing to develop this approach to ensure it gives a true Aotearoa New Zealand view of wellbeing. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1956,a,Grant Robertson,"This is a Government that will provide progressive leadership, much-needed reform, and a strong and confident plan for our nation's post - COVID-19 future. The Government has three goals this term: to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19, to accelerate our recovery and rebuild, and to tackle our foundational challenges—in particular, housing affordability, climate change, and child wellbeing. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1957,a,Grant Robertson,"Alongside this, we have an ambitious programme of system reform that will improve productivity, social outcomes, and wellbeing. This includes a complete overhaul of our health system, our planning laws, and the way we manage three waters.",20/05/2021 14:04
1958,a,Grant Robertson,"The three Budgets that I present this term will drive this ambitious programme, and they do need to be seen as a package. The change that we are seeking is wide ranging. We cannot deliver everything in one Budget, including our manifesto commitments, but what I will lay out today are our plans in each of our goal areas, where we will seek to go across the three Budgets of this term.",20/05/2021 14:04
1959,a,Grant Robertson,"New Zealand's response to COVID-19 has saved lives and livelihoods. With the benefit of hindsight, there are many views of what we could or should have done differently. Not everything was perfect. We had to make decisions swiftly and without much of the information we now have. It was also expensive. But then there were no costless decisions in COVID-19. I stand by our approach. We've done well, and we've given ourselves a head start that we are determined to capitalise on.",20/05/2021 14:04
1960,a,Grant Robertson,"Now is not the time to be complacent. Many countries around the world continue to have third and fourth waves of COVID-19. New variants are testing the health systems and responses in many places. Even where there have been successful responses, in places such as Vietnam and Taiwan, there have been significant recent outbreaks and restrictions. We need to continually adapt ourselves to the impacts of the virus and to building our defences against it.",20/05/2021 14:04
1961,a,Grant Robertson,"First and foremost in that is our vaccine programme. We have allocated just under $1.5 billion to the COVID-19 vaccine and immunisation programme, including just over $1 billion for advanced purchase agreements for vaccines and $357 million for the immunisation programme, along with funding to support the provision and delivery of the vaccine in the Pacific. We have made a great start towards our goal of vaccinating all New Zealanders who wish, over the age of 16, free of charge by the end of the year. We will continually update this programme, and there is scope in the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF) to increase spending if needed, including for expanding the programme to those under 16 if the scientific evidence supports doing so.",20/05/2021 14:04
1962,a,Grant Robertson,"We are also continuing to invest in our managed isolation and quarantine and other border facilities. As recently announced, we've opened up 500 places every two weeks to support more critical workers to come to Aotearoa New Zealand, including through the Regional Seasonal Employer scheme and for cohorts of international students to return here.",20/05/2021 14:04
1963,a,Grant Robertson,"The CRRF has continued to be a useful tool to support our response to COVID-19 and to manage it from a fiscal perspective as well. We are now moving more into the period where it is being used to support the recovery, as seen in a number of initiatives in this Budget. However, we have still maintained a buffer of just over $5 billion to support New Zealand in the now more unlikely event of a resurgence of COVID-19 that would lead to increased alert levels. It remains the responsible and precautionary thing to do.",20/05/2021 14:04
1964,a,Grant Robertson,"We are also taking steps to reconnect ourselves at a people-to-people level with the rest of the world. The trans-Tasman and Cook Island bubbles are important steps forward and, as the Prime Minister said last week, we will continue to look for opportunities to add other countries to this list when it is safe and appropriate to do so.",20/05/2021 14:04
1965,a,Grant Robertson,"We have also learned lessons from COVID-19. One of those is that, just as occurred after the Canterbury earthquakes and the GFC, the Government found itself having to put in place ad-hoc measures to protect the incomes of New Zealanders who had lost their jobs. We did this with the COVID-19 income relief payment. At the urging of Business New Zealand and the Council of Trade Unions (CTU), we have committed ourselves to the development of a social unemployment insurance scheme. Many countries around the world have such a scheme. We are investigating an ACC-style scheme that would provide 80 percent of income for a fixed period of time, with minimum and maximum caps, linked to training opportunities. This proposal is being developed by a tripartite working group with Business New Zealand and the CTU, and public consultation will occur later in the year.",20/05/2021 14:04
1966,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2021 is a recovery Budget. Our strong economic response over the past year has given us an opportunity to push on with an investment to create jobs and address long-term productivity issues in the economy. In this term of Government, we have a clear and simple goal to diversify and lift the value of what we produce, and grow the range of places we sell our goods and services to.",20/05/2021 14:04
1967,a,Grant Robertson,"To do this, we are developing industry transformation plans across seven areas of our economy where we believe we can get a global competitive advantage or where an industry sector needs to undergo transformation to significantly increase its level of productivity. These are in advanced manufacturing, agritech, food and beverage, digital, construction, tourism, forestry, and wood processing. These plans see an engagement with all stakeholders in the sectors so that the outcomes are well informed, aspirational, and achievable.",20/05/2021 14:04
1968,a,Grant Robertson,"Underpinning this is an investment in our research and development and export promotion. In Budget 2020, additional resources were provided to New Zealand Trade and Enterprise to boost our in-market and online presence as the world begins to recover from COVID-19. Two years of funding remains in this allocation. The Government is also committed to continuing to prioritise the negotiation of free-trade agreements with the European Union and the United Kingdom, and trade Minister Damien O'Connor will soon travel to the Northern Hemisphere to further advance our case with these jurisdictions.",20/05/2021 14:04
1969,a,Grant Robertson,"The centrepiece of investments to lift productivity in Budget 2021 is a $57.3 billion programme of infrastructure spending in the period 2021-25. This includes a $4 billion boost to the multi-year capital allowance, taking it to $12 billion over the four-year period. Across the four-year forecast period, there will be $10 billion of investment in roads and public transport projects through Waka Kotahi; $5.6 billion in education, including an additional $634.1 million in Budget 2021 for classrooms; and a further $700 million for district health board capital investment, taking the spend in that area across the four-year period to $6 billion.",20/05/2021 14:04
1970,a,Grant Robertson,"This investment will create jobs, improve productivity, strengthen communities, and make a significant dent in the infrastructure deficit that has built up over decades in Aotearoa New Zealand. We will continue to work with Te Waihanga, the Infrastructure Commission to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of this spend, and to seek opportunities to partner with local government, iwi, and the private sector to deliver quality infrastructure to support wellbeing.",20/05/2021 14:04
1971,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2021 continues our significant investment in rail. A total of $810 million is allocated to purchase new locomotives and wagons and upgrade existing stock, adding to the more than $4 billion we put into rail over the last term of Government. We are also fulfilling a commitment of the Labour Government to rebuild manufacturing in New Zealand. The rail allocation includes $85 million to build a local wagon assembly facility at the Hillside Workshops in South Dunedin. The facility will initially assemble 1,500 wagons, creating jobs and opportunities for apprenticeships, and for the first time in decades create some onshore resilience in our rail sector.",20/05/2021 14:04
1972,a,Grant Robertson,"In addition, Budget 2021 also provides the final stage of investment for a new South Island mechanical maintenance hub to be built at Waltham, in Christchurch, creating around 300 jobs through its construction. Budget 2021 also funds a $306 million redevelopment of Scott Base to ensure our presence in Antarctica is safeguarded. This will support up to 700 jobs over the six-year time frame of its work.",20/05/2021 14:04
1973,a,Grant Robertson,"A critical element of improving productivity is increasing the skills of our workforce. One of the major success stories of our economic response is the investment in apprenticeships and targeted trades training. Since we made them free from 1 July last year, we have seen more than 100,000 people take up that opportunity, including 57,000 apprentices. In addition, the Apprenticeship Boost programme has supported nearly 11,000 businesses to retain their apprentices to complete their qualifications. That programme is continuing, and today we add to it. Budget 2021 extends the Training Incentive Allowance from level 4 to level 7 qualifications. This will mean that 16,000 sole parents, disabled people, and carers will have financial support to get degree-level qualifications. The Budget continues investment in our reform of vocational education with $279.5 million to create a unified funding system that will see more New Zealanders get the skills and training they need to improve our productivity.",20/05/2021 14:04
1974,a,Grant Robertson,"The Budget also funds other active labour market programmes, such as the further expansion of the Tupu Aotearoa programme to support around 7,500 Pacific peoples into employment, training, or education.",20/05/2021 14:04
1975,a,Grant Robertson,"Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the heart of job creation in New Zealand. Through COVID-19, the Government has provided significant support to SMEs, including billions through the Wage Subsidy Scheme, $1.7 billion of low-interest loans through the Small Business Cashflow Scheme and $50 million in advisory support for businesses across the country. Budget 2021 builds on this with funding for a digital skills training programme for up to 60,000 small businesses. One of the main messages from small business in the wake of COVID-19 was the importance of having the knowledge and the tools to compete in a digital world. The Government is also supporting advisory services to help 30,000 businesses create digital business action plans.",20/05/2021 14:04
1976,a,Grant Robertson,"Many of our SMEs are in the tourism sector, that has been hardest hit by COVID-19. We've recently announced further support of $200 million to drive a recovery and reset of the sector. There is a particular focus on the hardest hit regions of Kaikōura, Mackenzie District, Queenstown Lakes, Fiordland, and South Westland. This package also commits $15 million to support Māori tourism operators, which will be deployed by New Zealand Māori Tourism. Budget 2021 also establishes the new Regional Strategic Partnership Fund, as committed to in Labour's manifesto.",20/05/2021 14:04
1977,a,Grant Robertson,"As I noted earlier, the Government is undertaking some major system reforms over this term of Government that will accelerate our recovery. Reform of our planning system is long overdue. It has become confused, inconsistent, and unclear for almost all participants. Led by environment Minister David Parker, the Government has embarked on a once-in-a-generation project to reform our resource management system so that it is fit for purpose, and the Budget invests $131.8 million to see this reform through all its stages.",20/05/2021 14:04
1978,a,Grant Robertson,"Alongside this major reform exercise is the Three Waters programme, led by local government Minister Nanaia Mahuta. Budget 2021 allocates a further $296 million to fund the costs of the creation of new entities to effectively, equitably, and efficiently manage water infrastructure and provide New Zealanders with safe supply wherever they live. The Government is committed to water remaining in public ownership, with local authorities, communities, iwi, and others playing a central role. We're making good progress on this work and expect to make further announcements on the details and further support for the programme in the coming months.",20/05/2021 14:04
1979,a,Grant Robertson,"Securing our recovery also requires a substantial investment so that the basic wellbeing needs of New Zealanders are being met and that we have world-class public services. At the centre of this in Budget 2021 is a record $4.7 billion increase in operating investment into Health over the forecast period. The total expenditure on health in the next financial year is $24 billion, some 45 percent higher than was spent by the National Government in its last year in office.",20/05/2021 14:04
1980,a,Grant Robertson,The Health reforms are another once-in-a-generation opportunity to see quality health services delivered to New Zealanders wherever they live. The Budget provides the initial funding for the transition and implementation. This includes the establishment of Health New Zealand and the Māori Health Authority. Both represent enormous opportunities to get more relevant and effective services to the people who need them the most.,20/05/2021 14:04
1981,a,Grant Robertson,"While the reform process is being implemented, it is vital that the Health system continues to deliver quality services. Budget 2021 invests $2.7 billion operating funding into district health boards over the forecast period. It also makes good on a number of election commitments to public health services. An additional $200 million is allocated to Pharmac to widen access to existing medicines and invest in new medicines. Since we have been in Government, we have increased Pharmac's budget by almost 25 percent, to over $1 billion per annum. The Budget almost doubles the number of cochlear implants available to adults. For those who receive these implants, it is a life-changing experience that can improve family and whānau and work life.",20/05/2021 14:04
1982,a,Grant Robertson,"There is also a boost for health services for the Pacific community to implement the Ola Manuia Action Plan, further additional funding for air and road ambulances, and the roll-out of the Bowel Screening Programme to the last remaining six DHBs. This is in addition to the previously announced funding for cervical and breast cancer screening.",20/05/2021 14:04
1983,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2021 makes significant investment in Education, including the already announced $170 million to take important steps to pay parity for early childhood teachers not in kindergarten settings. The Budget also commits funding to implement the system reform that education Minister Chris Hipkins started last term. This includes a new Education Service Agency and a flexible fund to support schools to identify and develop local solutions to meet the needs of learners. More than $110 million will support the development of the national curriculum, including a new curriculum centre. There's funding to complete the National Certificate of Educational Achievement Change Programme and to increase the number of students receiving support from the Attendance Service to provide intensive support to those learners at risk of disengaging. An $11.6 million allocation will expand the highly successful Reading Together and Duffy Books in Homes schemes.",20/05/2021 14:04
1984,a,Grant Robertson,"Educational opportunities for Māori and Pacific learners are also given a boost in Budget 2021. Over $150 million is allocated to support Māori education, including for boarding schools, lifting the pay of kōhanga reo teachers, and expanding Māori-medium education. There is also a lift of $20.8 million to support Pacific bilingual and immersion education.",20/05/2021 14:04
1985,a,Grant Robertson,"It is essential that the recovery from COVID-19 is one that addresses inequality. Recessions typically see already marginalised groups made worse off, and there's evidence that this has occurred in Aotearoa New Zealand in the wake of COVID-19. Budget 2021's boost to main benefits is designed to reduce inequality, at the same time as providing further stimulus to the economy. For too long the incomes of those who receive income support from the Government have been too low. The Government established the Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG), who made a clear argument for change.",20/05/2021 14:04
1986,a,Grant Robertson,"Over the past few Budgets, we have made significant moves to improve the wellbeing of those receiving benefits: the Families Package, including Best Start, the winter energy payment, plus the $25 per week increase to main benefits as part of the initial COVID-19 response. We also made the critical decision to index main benefits to wages in Budget 2019. Today, we are announcing the biggest increases in main benefit rates for more than a generation. By April next year, we will have moved all main benefit rates to the level recommended by WEAG and, in the cases of families and whānau with children, beyond those rates. We will do this in two tranches: the first on 1 July this year, when all benefits will increase by $20 per week; the second on 1 April next year, where benefits will increase by a range of amounts to meet the levels recommended by WEAG. Student support payments both for allowances and loans will increase by $25 per week from 1 April next year as well.",20/05/2021 14:04
1987,a,Grant Robertson,"These changes will make a significant difference to the wellbeing of our lowest-income earners. For a single Jobseeker 25 years or older, they will see a $48 per week increase as a result of the changes in this Budget. The total increase for them from changes implemented since we came into Government at the end of 2017 is $86 per week, representing a 38 percent increase in support. For a Jobseeker couple without children, they will see their support increase by $55 per adult as a result of this Budget, $77 more since 2017, representing a 40 percent increase.",20/05/2021 14:04
1988,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2021 also funds the announced changes to abatement rates that will allow those receiving benefits to earn at least $160 a week before their benefits are affected. This is the equivalent of eight hours at the minimum wage. We know that undertaking some work is an important step for people re-entering the labour market, and we are now providing far better incentives to do so.",20/05/2021 14:04
1989,a,Grant Robertson,"I want to recognise the work of the Prime Minister and the Hon Carmel Sepuloni in this package. Increases in main benefit rates will have a stimulatory effect on the economy. At a practical level, the stimulus will be felt in local businesses because we know that those on main benefits will spend in the communities in which they live.",20/05/2021 14:04
1990,a,Grant Robertson,"But for me this is primarily a moral issue. I recently watched a documentary about the reforms pushed through in the late 1980s and early 1990s in New Zealand. One person in that documentary made the comment that New Zealand would likely be paying the price for the cuts made well into the next century. Well, more than 20 years into this century that person has been proved disturbingly correct. Levels of hardship and deprivation have grown, with some periods of plateau, over the decades. The intergenerational effect on wellbeing has been enormous.",20/05/2021 14:04
1991,a,Grant Robertson,"Even in the constrained circumstances caused by the level of debt we've taken on to get through COVID-19, we have an obligation as a relatively wealthy nation not to accept the levels of inequality that are present in our society. Today is a major step in that direction but we are well aware that there is more for us to do. The Government has committed to tackling the foundational challenges in our economy and our society in this term of Government. In particular, we are focused on making significant progress in three areas: housing affordability, child wellbeing, and climate change. These will be a focus across all three Budgets this term. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1992,a,Grant Robertson,"It is the Government's goal that all New Zealanders have warm, dry, safe, and affordable housing to live in. We've invested significantly towards this goal over recent Budgets. The Government is on track to deliver on our promise of over 18,000 new housing places—public and transitional—by the end of 2024. To date, since we took office in 2017, we have delivered 7,631 net new public housing places, of which 5,848 are brand new builds. We have a fully funded public house building programme right through to 2024. We also have 1,005 transitional housing places as at February this year to provide urgent support to those most in need. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1993,a,Grant Robertson,"In March this year, we announced a comprehensive package of measures to address both demand and supply issues in our housing market. In today's Budget documents, the Treasury estimates that annual house price increases will peak this year at 17 percent before dropping in the 2021/22 year to 0.9 percent, as a result of both the Government's interventions and macro-prudential tools such as loan-to-value ratios. This is a sharp adjustment but a very necessary one. The Government's concern is not just that house price growth was unsustainable but also that the balance was too much in favour of speculators and investors and away from first-home buyers. Our interventions to remove interest deductibility and increase the brightline test were focused on this goal. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1994,a,Grant Robertson,"On the supply side, it is essential that we build more houses and, in particular, affordable houses and houses to rent. The reforms in March establish a tax incentive to build, with both the brightline extension and the removal of interest deductibility not applying to new builds. In today's Budget, we have appropriated the funding to establish the $3.8 billion Housing Acceleration Fund. This is a critical fund to ensure that the infrastructure is in place to make land build-ready. It is the number one issue identified by councils and developers. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1995,a,Grant Robertson,"The Budget also invests $380 million in Māori housing through the initiative, Whai Kāinga Whai Oranga. We know that Māori are far less likely to own their own homes. In 2018, the Māori homeownership rate, including family trusts, was 31 percent whereas for the total population the rate was 52 percent. We have a responsibility to address this inequity, and today's announcement makes an important start. To support the building of new homes, we have ring-fenced $350 million of the Housing Acceleration Fund to provide infrastructure to support this programme. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1996,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2021 also provides Kāinga Ora with substantial resources to acquire land and over $133 million to carry out its urban development functions, and it funds the increased support within First Home Products announced in March. Ongoing and sustained investment in housing is required to ensure that there is affordability for all.",20/05/2021 14:04
1997,a,Grant Robertson,"The Budget is being delivered just under two weeks ahead of the planned release of the final report of the independent climate commission. The draft of the report of the commission makes sober and essential reading. It lays out the scale of the task for Aotearoa New Zealand to meet the emissions reductions required to meet our zero-carbon targets and our Paris Agreement commitments. Given the timing of the commission's report, while this Budget takes some important steps forward, it will be in Budgets 2022 and 2023 that we will see further commitments being made. In recognition of that, I am announcing today that it is my intention that from Budget 2022 onwards we will hypothecate—or recycle—the revenue generated from the emissions trading scheme into emissions reductions programmes. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1998,a,Grant Robertson,"Climate change Minister James Shaw and I are currently working on a long-term plan for the financing of our climate change goals. My view is that the current way in which Budgets are required to be produced makes it difficult to make the sustained and long-term investments needed to fix an intergenerational, multi-faceted, complex problem like climate change. We will report back to Cabinet before the next Budget process gets under way on our proposals on this work. ",20/05/2021 14:04
1999,a,Grant Robertson,"In this Budget, we have allocated significant resources to help shift the dial on our emissions reductions—$300 million has been allocated to New Zealand Green Investment Finance Limited (NZGIF), the investment vehicle established in the Labour/Green confidence and supply agreement in our last term of Government. This is a quadrupling of the funding available. We will be asking NZGIF to have a particular focus on decarbonising public transport, and the waste and plastics sectors in using this new investment to reduce emissions.",20/05/2021 14:04
2000,a,Grant Robertson,"Budget 2021 also establishes a $302 million tagged contingency to implement a regime to incentivise the uptake of low-emissions vehicles. This complements the implementation of a Clean Car Standard that is also funded through this Budget.

2001,a,Grant Robertson,"Other initiatives in Budget 2021 that contribute to our climate change programme include $67.4 million to implement the Carbon Neutral Government programme, the extension of the Warmer Kiwi Homes programme for another 47,700 homes, more support for the low emission vehicle fund, and more support for businesses to transition to low-emissions energy. ",20/05/2021 14:04
2002,a,Grant Robertson,"The primary sector also receives support through the Budget to tackle on-farm emissions. This includes ensuring up to 40,000 farmers and growers have the tools they need to improve on-farm performance and meet freshwater and greenhouse gas requirements by 2025. ",20/05/2021 14:04
2003,a,Grant Robertson,"As with the past two Budgets, today I am presenting a child poverty report as mandated by the Public Finance Act. The report shows that the Government's actions to date have reduced child poverty rates, using the after-housing cost measure, to the extent that there are 43,000 fewer children in low-income households and 18,000 fewer children experiencing material hardship. This is one of the largest policy-driven falls in measured child poverty in decades. But, equally, we know that there is more to do to meet all the clear targets laid out in this report. ",20/05/2021 14:04
2004,a,Grant Robertson,"This Budget takes a significant step forward, in particular, through the main benefit increases. In addition to meeting the levels recommended by WEAG, the Budget provides an additional $15 per adult per week to families and whānau with children from 1 April next year. This will mean that up to another 33,000 children on the after-housing measure are projected to be lifted out of poverty as a result—109,000 families and whānau with children will be better off by $40 per week as a result of these changes and, on average, $175 per week in total better off as a result of the changes made by the Government since being elected in 2017. This represents an enormous change in the lives of these people. It will mean, as one person asked for on television as their Budget wish, that we will put shoes on the feet of our children and food in their stomachs. ",20/05/2021 14:04
2005,a,Grant Robertson,"Speaking of which, Budget 2021 funds the extension of the Ka Ora, Ka Ako Healthy School Lunch programme to the tune of $526.9 million. It also puts in place the indexation of childcare assistance income thresholds to the average wage, which will benefit over 1,000 families and whānau, or around 1,500 children. The Budget provides for 3,300 places for children in Out of School Care and Recreation services, supporting their parents or caregivers to transition into employment, education, or training.

2007,a,Grant Robertson,"This Budget is about securing our recovery. New Zealanders have done the hard work of coming together to fight COVID-19. Our success is the envy of many across the world. We have supported lives and livelihoods, we've found cash flow and confidence, and we've managed to have lives of relative normality when others have faced difficult and debilitating restrictions. Our economy has been resilient, and our people compassionate and strong. I say thank you to each and every person who has contributed to that—in business, as workers, in our communities, on our marae, and in every part of New Zealand.

2014,Speech,Speaker," I've received a letter from Chris Bishop seeking to debate, under Standing Order 399, the report of the Controller and Auditor-General on the preparations for the nationwide roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine. This is a particular matter of recent occurrence. There is no ministerial responsibility for the report of an Officer of Parliament because they are the responsibility of the Speaker—Speakers' rulings 201/6, 202/1, and 202/2. However, the Government including the ministry's response to such a report could be the subject of an urgent debate application. Unfortunately, that request was not made. ",19/05/2021 14:50
2015,a,Speaker,"However, it may be some consolation for the members to know that when considering an application for an urgent debate—or whether it's relevant—it is relevant whether there are other parliamentary means of discussing the subject. In this instance, the member lodged an oral question, his leader asked supplementaries on it, and there is the opportunity in the general debate to raise it. The Budget debate commences tomorrow and is very wide ranging; it will offer the member an opportunity to debate the report and the Government's response to it. For those reasons, the application is declined.",19/05/2021 14:50

2017,Speech,Marama Davidson," Mr Speaker, point of order. Mr Speaker, I acknowledge that I am actually seeking your leeway to raise a point of order related to question No. 1 in the House today. I required some time to go through the Speakers' Rulings. So I wanted to ask that—recently you have ruled in this House about your interpretation of Speakers' rulings 44/1 and 44/2 regarding allegations of racism. Mr Speaker, I am asking could you further reflect on those rulings, especially 44/1, because that came from 1998 and, effectively, rules that no member in this House can ever be racist—which is actually not reflective of a House of Representatives and does not help towards raising the standard of debate in this House when we start to undermine debate as including harmful, racist narrative. ",12/05/2021 14:53
2018,Speech,Speaker," Speaking to the point of order, the Hon Michael Woodhouse.",12/05/2021 14:54
2019,Speech,Michael Woodhouse," Thank you, Mr Speaker. I think this a very important issue, and it's been raised two or three times in the last month. To the last point that Ms Davidson just raised, the Standing Orders are very clear that, while accusations of racism are not to be levelled, it is entirely within the Speaker's prerogative to rule matters out and to judge them, or for a member to take offence. In respect of Speaker's ruling 44/1, I would suggest to you that Speaker Kidd's ruling is enduring, because it goes to the question of the perception of things that are interpreted in questions or in speech comments that may or may not be the intention of the speaker—and it's very clear, in that second sentence, or third sentence: ""I understand the feelings of members who feel that the policies or views of other members are objectionable. They must be permitted to criticise those policies or views in strong terms."" So that goes both ways. But to automatically presume that because a certain line of questioning, which you've ruled is in the Standing Orders, should be ruled out because somebody has a perception that it carries with it an inference I think would demean the quality of the debate and the freedom that we have, the privileges that we have, in this House to engage in robust but reasonable debate in accordance with the Standing Orders.",12/05/2021 14:54
2020,Speech,David Seymour," Point of order, Mr Speaker. I do feel that this is a point that needs to be addressed. The purpose of this House, we all agree, is to scrutinise and hold to account the executive. Now, the executive appears to have some policy initiatives which are racially explicit—that means that they need to be debated by this House; that can often be uncomfortable. I, personally, would prefer that they weren't, but to somehow restrict the House from being able to debate the executive's policies with charges of racism was rightly ruled out by previous Speakers. If anything, the influx of racially explicit policy on the part of the executive makes it more necessary that we are able freely to debate them.",12/05/2021 14:56
2021,Speech,Chris Hipkins," Having just had a quick read of the Speaker's ruling in question, I think the overall objective here was to get members debating the substance of an issue rather than using labels in order to characterise one another. I think members expressing concern about sentiments being expressed on one side of the House or another is absolutely legitimate; it is a legitimate part of debate. I think what Speaker Kidd—and, in fact, I think he maybe even references that in his ruling—suggests is that using a single word as a lazy shorthand to characterise a member's concerns isn't the way to go; that, if you have an objection with what someone is saying, elaborate on that, debate it, rather than simply throw labels at each other.",12/05/2021 14:57
2022,Speech,Chris Bishop," Speaking to the point of order, I want to echo exactly what Mr Hipkins just said then, and also what David Seymour said in his contribution. The simple reality is that we have a political constitution in this country, in the sense that it's for the Parliament to decide our constitutional arrangements, and the reality is that the Treaty of Waitangi, signed between Māori and Pākehā settlers into New Zealand, is something that will always be, and has always been in the time we've had parliamentary democracy, the subject of intense debate in the Parliament. That's the reality, and we should not inhibit debate around that in this House.",12/05/2021 14:57
2023,Speech,Marama Davidson," Thank you, Mr Speaker. I acknowledge—and am asking genuinely for your guidance—we have the Speakers' Rulings available to us that are procedural. I am also looking for your guidance on how we can have genuine debate without marginalising entire groups of communities, including tangata whenua, who feel that the standard of debate in this House is not at all welcoming or inviting to actual democratic debate on the important issues of how our country comes together in the future.",12/05/2021 14:58
2024,Speech,Speaker," Order! [Interruption] Order! I am going to say that, in this point of order in particular, I'm going to rule strictly that it will be heard in silence. There are some comments that are just not helpful.",12/05/2021 14:59
2025,Speech,Chris Hipkins," The House is, in fact, about to—or I suspect; unless there's something else about to happen that I don't know about—engage in an hour of debate where members can do exactly that; they can raise whatever issues they wish to. The issue around the word ""racist"", I think, falls into a similar category as the word ""liar"" or ""hypocrite"" or other such labels, which are also not allowed to be used in the House. Though members may deeply hold the view that what somebody on the other side has said fits one of those descriptions, those are descriptions that we can't use. We are encouraged to engage in debate that is a little more sophisticated than that.",12/05/2021 14:59
2026,Speech,James Shaw," Speaking to the point of order, I think there are a number of issues that need to be disaggregated, one of which is that the Treaty is a legal instrument between two peoples. If they were peoples of the same ethnicity, it wouldn't be conflated with race, and yet that is how it's been conflated in the House.",12/05/2021 14:59
2027,a,James Shaw,"The second issue is that the tone or certain labels that get used in question time, or have been used in question time recently, are offensive to some members but, under the rules of the House, under the procedural rules that the Hon Marama Davidson was referring to, we're unable to say that we take offence, because it's not directed at an individual member of Parliament. So we can't, within the procedures, say that we take offence to something that another member has said as part of question time.",12/05/2021 14:59
2028,a,James Shaw,"I think the third component here is that, ultimately, we are talking about the tangata whenua, the indigenous people, who are in a minority in this House and, therefore, are unable to express the offence that has been taken by the narrative or some of those labels that are being thrown around as a result of other members of the House, due to the nature of those procedures. That is why we are raising the point as a point of order within the rules around question time.",12/05/2021 14:59
2029,Speech,Speaker, I'm getting close to being able to rule.,12/05/2021 15:01
2030,Speech,Gerry Brownlee," Mr Speaker, I think the challenge that's being put down to you is trying to work out how you, in fact, deal with debate on policy that is formulated, essentially, on race, without offending those who consider that such a debate should not take place, and that there should be no question about the basis of the policy itself. And that is, I think, the fine line that you're being asked to walk, and we look forward to your consideration of that.",12/05/2021 15:01
2031,Speech,Nicole Mckee," Point of order, Mr Speaker. I am one of those indigenous peoples, and I sit here in this House as a representative of others as well. And when we have politicians that say that they speak for my race that I belong to, I find that they're not actually speaking for me. So I would actually like to be able to have the debate that's being held. While we do all know that some people find things offensive, others actually believe that we do need to have this debate, and this is what this House is about. I do not find some of the comments that have been made as being racist, but, rather, looking at ways of working through solutions to the issues that have been put in front of us. And the representatives for the minority walked out of this House. They didn't abide by the rules of this House, and, therefore, they have walked away from the people that they said that they want to represent.",12/05/2021 15:02
2032,a,Nicole Mckee,So I think it's very important that we consider—,12/05/2021 15:02
2033,Intervention,Speaker, Order! Come right back to that rather than reflecting on what happened.,12/05/2021 15:02
2034,ContinueSpeech,Nicole Mckee, I would like to be able to continue to have a debate on the laws that go through here—an open and honest conversation on every piece of legislation that we debate in the House. Thank you. [Interruption],12/05/2021 15:02
2035,Speech,Speaker, Order! ,12/05/2021 15:03
2036,Speech,Chris Bishop," Speaking to the point of order. I think Mr Brownlee has summarised the position, the dilemma, that you have to confront. The implication of the points of order from Ms Davidson and Mr Shaw are quite troubling, because they are asking you to go beyond Speakers' rulings, essentially, which are that you can't call someone, directly, racist, but that labels should be interpreted as, essentially, racist, or some language should be interpreted in that light even if it's not intended in that light. Actually, I point out that no examples have been given around the language that some members—Green members—have found offensive. So we would put it to you, from the National Opposition, that the current Speakers' rulings around improper language more than suffice, and we should allow robust and free debate in this House.",12/05/2021 15:03
2037,Speech,Speaker, This is the last contribution.,12/05/2021 15:04
2038,Speech,Aupito William Sio," Mr Speaker, there are various worlds here, and they're colliding because the system here is not an indigenous system. I'm not trying to defend what's occurred; what I'm saying, which I think has been demonstrated here, is that there are certain issues of debate within this House where there's a duty of care in how we approach it. How it's handled in this House also has rippling effects on the wider community. And for minority groups, including myself, it is quite painful to sit in here knowing that, whilst it is a robust House here, where all things are open for debate, there's a line that often crosses here. And I think it's no different from us also being careful about sexual harassment and abuse, that we've often talked about.",12/05/2021 15:04
2039,Intervention,Speaker," I want to thank members for what I think has been a useful discussion. I'm going to make a ruling now but reserve the right to come back again if I think it needs to be updated. My starting point—and I go back to comments that the Hon Dr Lockwood Smith made around hypocrisy in the past—is that there is a difference between calling an individual a racist and criticising either a policy or a view as being racist. I think that's essentially the point that the Hon Mr Brownlee was making: that some people in this House have the view that some policies are racist. Some people have the view that other members' views are racist. In my opinion, ruling that out would be excluding the rights to free speech, which we value substantially.",12/05/2021 15:04
2040,a,Aupito William Sio,"On the question of just the use of words, Speakers can and have regularly ruled specific words out. Calling someone a liar, I think, is one which is pretty straightforward with the expressions that happen in this House. So I think the essence of my ruling is asking people to take care as they express themselves, to think of the wider consequences when they do, but I am not going to ask one part of the House to refrain from suggestions that some policies are race-based or, effectively, racist, and I'm not going to stop another group in the House expressing the view that other members' views—not the members themselves but the views expressed—are, in fact, racist. I think that will get the balance about right. It will leave the freedom of speech, but it will stop people saying that individuals are racist, which I think most members would find offensive.",12/05/2021 15:04
2041,Speech,Michael Woodhouse," Speaking to that, if I may. I do appreciate your indulgence, Mr Speaker, but you have just made a comment that—I infer from it that what you have said is that, while a party may have a line of speaking or questioning that is racist, it's still within the Standing Orders. I find that very troubling, so could I ask you: if you have examples of speech that you believe met that definition, then please forward it to the shadow Leader of the House. Or, alternatively, if that wasn't what you wanted to imply, could we have that clarification too? I mean, we're talking about subjective assessments of what people think people are saying and then the offence that they take from it. If I have heard you say that, I am very concerned about it.",12/05/2021 15:08
2042,Intervention,Speaker," I want to indicate that if people had listened carefully to the reactions of some members in the House today, we would have seen—we could see—that some members view the approach taken by others as racist. It's a genuinely held view—clearly genuinely held. We saw it from the Māori Party today. We can argue about whether they are right or wrong, but I think it gets really hard if they are not allowed to express their views. I want to also say that I took some inferences from questioning today that a major party viewed a possible policy direction in exactly the same way. I don't think either side should be refrained from expressing the view, as long as it is not personalised to members.",12/05/2021 15:08
2043,a,Michael Woodhouse,"Now, I'm quite willing to continue this discussion later on in my room, if people would like to, and I'd certainly welcome any considered notes on it, because, as I indicated before, it is a very important area. I'll reiterate something that I said yesterday. That is that I think—[Interruption] Mr Bennett—that matters which might have been seen as not being racist in New Zealand 20 or 40 years ago are now, and having members call things like that for as they see them is something which I wouldn't want to prevent.",12/05/2021 15:08

Ensuring transparency of the performance of the health and disability system through the publication of data and information is very important to me. This includes providing the public with robust, timely, and fit for purpose data about the performance of the mental health and addiction sector. On Friday afternoon last week, I received further advice from the Ministry of Health that at the time of my statement, seven discrete pieces of relevant information were not publicly reported through other avenues.

2057,a,Speaker,"Increasingly, Ministers are proactively releasing papers. This should greatly help public access to information. It has the potential to save time for members and to reduce the number of written questions lodged to seek routine information and I encourage it. There have been two main concerns raised with me. The first is that references by a Minister to information being online have not always been specific enough to assist in the location of the information. I would remind members of Speaker's ruling 194/5, which states that if a Minister chooses to reply by directing a member to information already available, it must be done with some particularity. It is not acceptable to simply state that the information has already been released. Rather, the Minister should provide a sufficiently detailed answer to enable the member to directly locate the information.",5/05/2021 14:03
2058,a,Speaker,"The other concern is the timeliness of proactive information releases. If information is not released in a timely way, it causes unreasonable delays to members receiving substantive replies to their written questions. Under Standing Orders [392(4)], members are entitled to receive a reply to a written question within six working days. It is not reasonable for them to have to wait much longer than that for a proactive release of information. Therefore, I am ruling that if the information requested in a written question will not be made available for two weeks or more, the Minister must provide a substantive reply to the written question rather than refer the member to information that will be released in the future. Where Ministers do refer a member to information available elsewhere, they must provide specific details to assist in locating it.",5/05/2021 14:03

Mr Speaker, when you were earlier this year considering business attire, there were some submissions that were concerned that allowing MPs not to wear ties would be the beginning of a slippery slope towards a very different standard of dress in the Chamber. And I wonder if you might like to reflect on that this afternoon.",15/04/2021 14:02

2073,a,Chris Hipkins,"This is an annual event that the Parliament goes through. It concerns the appropriations for our three Officers of Parliament: the Controller and Auditor-General, the Ombudsmen, and the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment. It sets out any alterations to their appropriations for the current year. This, for every other Government entity, is done through Supplementary Estimates. Officers of Parliament are subject to a different process—this process, and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment. And it also sets out the main appropriations that will be included in the main Appropriation Bill that the Minister of Finance will introduce on Budget day. The process maintains the independence of the Officers of Parliament. It is not the Government that sets the budget or that agrees to the alterations to that budget for these entities; it is the Parliament as a whole. And that is what this motion is all about: maintaining the independence.",15/04/2021 15:23
2074,a,Chris Hipkins,"The proposals in the address have been examined by the Officers of Parliament Committee, which has the Speaker as its chairperson. The committee's report explains the detail and it examines the issues behind the numbers proposed in the Address. It includes the fact that the Auditor-General is needing to retain skilled staff and deal with some remuneration issues there. It increases funding for the Ombudsmen in order to allow for them to inspect managed isolation and quarantine facilities and deal with complaints relating to COVID-19 and deal with security requirements from a significant increase in threatening approaches from aggrieved complainants. And with regard to the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, it addresses their main cost pressure, which is the need to find new premises.",15/04/2021 15:23
2075,Speech,Speaker," I have received a letter from David Seymour seeking to debate under Standing Order 399 the letter of expectation sent by the Minister of Finance to the chairperson of Air New Zealand. I have also received a letter from Chris Bishop seeking to debate evidence given to the Health Committee that case B in the most recent series of COVID-19 cases was not tested for COVID-19 between November 2020 and 8 April 2021. Mr Bishop's application relates to a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. The COVID-19 testing regime and border controls are important matters which deserve the attention of the House. Ordinarily, I could very well accept this application; however, there is a means of debating it in the House today. The debate on the Budget Policy Statement relates to the statement itself and the Finance and Expenditure Committee's report on it. While Speaker's ruling 132/4 points out that the debate is not as wide-ranging as a Budget debate, I think the statement and the report canvass COVID-19-related issues sufficiently to permit the House to address the matters raised in the urgent debate application.",14/04/2021 15:02
2076,Speech,Speaker," The subject of David Seymour's letter is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. Air New Zealand is a significant company and any significant change in the Government's relationship with it is important. The matter deserves the attention of the House and there is no other opportunity to do this for about three weeks. Therefore, I call on David Seymour to move that the House take note of a matter of urgent public importance.",14/04/2021 15:04
2077,Speech,Chris Hipkins," Point of order, Mr Speaker. I apologise to David Seymour for slightly interrupting his kicking off this debate. My point of order is not to do with that. It is do with the ruling that you made on Mr Bishop's application.",14/04/2021 15:04
2078,a,Chris Hipkins,"Whilst I understand you've ruled that the debate should not be held today, and I understand your reasons for doing so, your indication that in a different set of circumstances a debate might be held raises some concern in that Mr Bishop's application relates to a particular individual. There are issues of natural justice when Parliament is being asked to scrutinise the actions of one individual member of the public, and I'd ask you to re-think whether such an application in the future would be treated consistently with the ruling that you had indicated it might do in a different set of circumstances.",14/04/2021 15:04
2079,a,Chris Hipkins,"That individual would not be part of the debate. They would not have the ability to—the very issue of the statements they have made are ultimately going to be a large part of the subject of the debate, and there are other investigations ongoing, including whether or not the person concerned may be subject to other forms of sanction for those actions. Therefore, that would seem to me to be quite unwise for the Parliament to, effectively, be acting as judge and jury regarding that particular individual.",14/04/2021 15:04
2080,Speech,David Seymour," Thank you, Mr Speaker. I move, That the House take note of a matter of urgent public importance.",14/04/2021 15:06
2081,a,David Seymour,"That matter is a letter sent by Grant Robertson on behalf of the Government to Dame Therese Walsh, the chair of Air New Zealand. This letter has been described by Fran O'Sullivan, one of our most senior journalists and respected business journalists, in the New Zealand Herald as a ""shocker."" And she does not use that term lightly, because that's exactly what this letter is. It is a letter sent to the business, a commercial airline that has achieved enormous success and many international awards along with an exceptional reputation amongst New Zealanders. It's been sent to that business and it set out a series of mutually competing and, in some cases, contradictory expectations that, in my view, put the directors of that company in an impossible position. The implications are not just for Air New Zealand, they are for all of New Zealand, because what this letter means is that good people who sign up to be directors on companies to aid New Zealand by offering their skills may find themselves put in positions where they simply cannot discharge their legal obligations with the political pressure that surrounds them.",14/04/2021 15:06
2082,a,David Seymour,"I recognise the narrowness of this debate, but it is worth acknowledging some of the storied history that got us here. Not so long ago, in some people's lives at least, we had a Prime Minister who was also the Minister of Finance and ruled and micro-managed with an iron fist. Rob Muldoon went over to the UK and agreed that the National Airways Corporation, or Air New Zealand, would use Rolls-Royce jet engines instead of General Electric, even though Air New Zealand was not set up to service Rolls-Royce engines. So the people trying to run the business went through the machinations of trying to actually figure out how to land and take off on time and serve their customers and run an effective airline while dealing with the most unconscionable political interference. The reasons that we have an State-owned enterprise (SOE) model, the reasons that Air New Zealand and many other SOEs are operating as private businesses with an objective to their shareholders, is actually to avoid that kind of micro-managing interference that makes it impossible for the directors and management of a company to deliver a useful service to their customers.",14/04/2021 15:06
2083,a,David Seymour,"And this letter says, given the critical role Air New Zealand plays in the success of New Zealand, both socially and economically, the Government's enduring expectations for Air New Zealand are to be a ""national airline"", and it must continue to operate to support economic development, including access to international markets for our exporters and international tourism linkages once international borders reopen.",14/04/2021 15:06
2084,a,David Seymour,"Now, if the directors are to take the letter—which has come from someone who's the Deputy Prime Minister and the major shareholder—seriously, then they've got to do that. But they've also got to maintain comprehensive domestic route networks that allow people and goods to move across New Zealand in a timely fashion at a reasonable cost. Well, to what extent should the directors put weight on that particular matter? And then they have to demonstrate their commitment to environmental sustainability, despite being an airline whose primary business is blasting large vehicles through the air. And they have to also engage with the development of new aviation fuels for New Zealand. So, so far, they've got to be a network for exporting and connecting with the rest of the world, maintain a domestic network that's comprehensive—whatever that means—at a reasonable cost, and deliver goods and people across New Zealand in a timely manner, but they've also got to try and save the planet by engaging in the development of new aviation fuels.",14/04/2021 15:06
2085,a,David Seymour,"But wait, there's more. You might think that Air New Zealand would have to lean quite hard on its employees in order to get them to deliver what is starting to sound like a monumental task, but, actually, they also have to be a leader in best practice workplace relations, given it is one of New Zealand's largest employers. So they not only have a role as an airline delivering things around the world and New Zealand, not only do they have to help invent new fuels, but they also—according to this letter from the Deputy Prime Minister, from their chief shareholder—have to actually make sure that they're a world leader in workplace relations. And then they have to continue acting as a responsible corporate citizen. ",14/04/2021 15:06
2086,a,David Seymour,"Now, I have to assume that that was put in as a bit of filler. But anyway, that's another thing that they have to do. If the board are going to discharge their duties in good conscience, then they also have to do that. And then, here's the kicker—here's the kicker—they have to achieve these objectives while operating as a commercially sustainable and capital efficient business. So not only do they have multiple, and at times conflicting, objectives put on them by the Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand, they also have to do it while making good use of capital and actually be commercially sustainable.",14/04/2021 15:06
2087,a,David Seymour,"These are not all the objectives that the directors will have. The directors also have an objective, which is in the Companies Act, section 131 if I remember correctly, that they must act in accordance with what they see as the best interests of the company. Now, if you are a director, somebody of serious calibre, in that sort of position, who has options, who is invited to be on a range of different boards—in some cases in New Zealand but in many cases, for our top directors in New Zealand, across the Ditch and further afield as well—what has just happened to the attractiveness of serving our national carrier, of being on the board of Air New Zealand? Well, you are put in a nearly impossible position where you may not be able to achieve all of the conflicting objectives you have, including those recently given to you in a rather aggressive letter by the Deputy Prime Minister of the country.",14/04/2021 15:06
2088,a,David Seymour,"And then—here's the kicker—here's what comes next: see, that is a difficult situation but some people might say, ""You're taking it too seriously. Maybe it doesn't really have the kind of weight and gravity that's been made out by people like Fran O'Sullivan in the New Zealand Herald."" Well, here's what it says next, the letter says—menacingly, I would say—""I would like to be involved in the renewal of the board."" Now, these are smart people, they can read on the line and between the lines, and they know what it means. It means: ""If you don't fulfil my fantasy as a shareholder, then I am going to find other employment for you; actually, I won't—I'll just make sure that you're not reappointed on this board.""",14/04/2021 15:06
2089,a,David Seymour,"But this is not just a shame because of the damage it does to Air New Zealand. Yes, it is true: it is wrong, it will harm the quality of people who want to be on and remain on the Air New Zealand board, and it will affect the value of the company and its operation. All of those things are true. But it is worth remembering that the SOE model is applied to Air New Zealand amongst a number of organisations, and there is quite a range of them. There are some very important businesses in the electricity generation space. Now, we have a major issue with electricity generation right now. There is a shortage of electricity. Prices are high. It is threatening the deindustrialisation of New Zealand. We need quality governance in the generation and ""gen-tailer"" space if we are going to have a competitive energy market that is also going to achieve the objectives of more environmentally friendly electricity. Those were some of the big SOEs.",14/04/2021 15:06
2090,a,David Seymour,"What message does this letter—and they've all read about it, I can guarantee you; there won't be a single corporate director in this country who is not aware of what is going on here. What affect does it have on the people on those boards? And it is a few others. It is organisations that are SOEs that hold data for the weather and actually do all sorts of useful services. Well, they are all going to be tarred with the same brush that Grant Robertson has tarred Air New Zealand with. That means that we are going to have a decline in the quality of governance.",14/04/2021 15:06
2091,a,David Seymour,"Some people might say, ""Well, this is just one instance. We're on new ground here."" Actually, I think it is important that public policy is evidence-based. We, over the last 40 years, have had the benefit of enormous evidence of over $2 trillion of privatisations, and there have been studies—there have been studies of those studies—there have been people like Phil Barry, the economist here in Wellington, who have played a role in evaluation the effects of shifting Government enterprises from public ownership to private. And guess what! Private and privatised entities, in the long run, on average, over time, outperform public entities like for like in terms of productivity.",14/04/2021 15:06
2092,a,David Seymour,"So not only is it, on the face of it, wrong what the Minister has done to Air New Zealand's board, we actually have good reasoning and good evidence and good data built up over many decades which tells us that this action by the Minister is going to make us all poorer. And that leads you to the question: what can we do about it? Because anybody can point out what is wrong, but the next thing we need to do is actually figure out how we can have some honest conversations about uniting New Zealanders behind good ideas that will make us more prosperous.",14/04/2021 15:06
2093,a,David Seymour,"What the Minister could do is a little bit like what another Minister did just before question time. Stuart Nash rang up Nicole McKee and said, ""Sorry, I called you a nutter"", and Nicole McKee very graciously accepted that apology. I think we saw the true colours of both politicians. Well, Grant Robertson has the opportunity to show his true colours and say, ""I've made a mistake here. It is wrong what I have done. I'm actually prepared to go and say that this is not a good way to operate. This is not a good way for a shareholder to operate a company. If you want a company to achieve certain objectives, then, actually, you've got to allow them the freedom to actually pursue those objectives, otherwise, if I know what they should be doing, then maybe I don't need a board anyway. Instead of what I've done, I'm going to rescind the letter."" ",14/04/2021 15:06
2094,a,David Seymour,"Grant Robertson should rescind the letter that he has sent to the board, and send a signal to governance organisations and particularly SOEs up and down New Zealand that this Government does not engage in wanton interference in commercial affairs, and that it respects the people that have been appointed to governance positions and it is going to uphold the best practices that attract the best people to govern the organisations that we need to be well governed in this country.",14/04/2021 15:06
2095,a,David Seymour,"That is the opportunity that the Minister of Finance has, and if he is not prepared to do it for Air New Zealand or for those in governance roles or for the wider country and the future of SOEs, here is another reason why he might do it. What does he think the long-term effect—other things being equal, you know, without the current monetary policy conditions—on the share value of Air New Zealand is going to be for all of those New Zealanders who have KiwiSaver interests in Air New Zealand? What does he think it is going to be in the long term? Does he really think that Air New Zealand is going to be a more profitable company for those investors in the long term, and on average, with him sticking his ore in and interfering in its governance? ",14/04/2021 15:06
2096,a,David Seymour,"And if the Minister wants to get up and tell all of those New Zealanders that their investment is better with him running it, then that is a very interesting claim for him to make. I will be interested to see if he does. But what would be far better is if he apologised to those investors, apologised to Dame Therese Walsh, apologised to those in governance positions in Air New Zealand and SOEs up and down New Zealand, and affirmed his Government's commitment to trusting people that have been appointed to do the job, and let them get on with it without political interference.

2100,a,Jacinda Ardern,[Rest in the hands of the Lord.],13/04/2021 14:01
2101,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Prince Philip's long life was marked by his devotion to duty and his unwavering support for Her Majesty. When he stepped down from his duties in 2017, aged 96, it was estimated that he had attended over 22,000 official engagements as consort to Her Majesty. In doing so, he had to sacrifice his own naval career and dedicate his life to supporting the Crown. ",13/04/2021 14:01
2102,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Prince Philip will be long remembered for his down-to-earth style and formidable sense of humour. Sometimes his directness created controversy, but he never shied away from his sense of duty. Just this morning I received an email from a woman whose daughter was selected to help Prince Philip plant a tree in the botanic gardens during one royal visit. Jess, a Brownie at the time, watched His Royal Highness working with a spade for a while before telling him, ""You're not very good at that."" Apparently, he laughed, delighted by the candid feedback. ",13/04/2021 14:01
2103,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Prince Philip accompanied Her Majesty on every one of her visits to New Zealand, from her first overseas tour as Queen in 1953 to her last visit here in 2002. He also visited New Zealand separately on a further four occasions. But his connections with this country run far deeper than just these visits. Prince Philip will probably be best remembered in New Zealand for the Duke of Edinburgh's Hillary Award, which provides life-changing opportunities for young people to learn new skills, get physically active, and give service to their communities. Achieving the award has been a transformative experience for many, including in prisons, teen parent units, refugee centres, and well over 300 schools. Together, the 250,000 who have received an award form an enduring legacy of His Royal Highness in New Zealand. ",13/04/2021 14:01
2104,a,Jacinda Ardern,"One of these 250,000 rangatahi, a student from Auckland, summed up the experience for so many. She said that when she went on her first bronze tramp, she wondered what she'd got herself into, but by the time she qualified for her gold award, she wondered why she'd ever had doubts. The Duke's goal of empowering young people to find their own confidence and ability was truly achieved through this programme. ",13/04/2021 14:01
2105,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Additionally, the Duke held the highest honorary ranks in the New Zealand Defence Force. He was made Admiral of the Fleet of the Royal New Zealand Navy during a solo visit to New Zealand in 1958 on the Royal Yacht Britannia, and to commemorate the Queen's silver jubilee in 1977 he was made Field Marshal of the New Zealand Army and Marshal of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. The Duke was patron of the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, reflecting his lifelong love of the sea and sailing, and patron of the New Zealand Society in the United Kingdom. He was a life member and Badge in Gold award holder of the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association, and life member of Aviation New Zealand and the Tin Hat Club. He was an honorary member of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Veterans Association and the Wellington Club. He was also involved with a number of Commonwealth associations, such as the Royal Agricultural Society of the Commonwealth. ",13/04/2021 14:01
2106,a,Jacinda Ardern,New Zealanders formally recognised the Duke of Edinburgh's service to New Zealand by awarding him a number of honours and appointments. He was appointed an Extra Companion of the Queen's Service Order (QSO) in 1981—and I note the QSO badge features prominently at the front of his extensive medal bar—and received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. On 4 June 2012 he was appointed an Additional Member of the Order of New Zealand to commemorate the Queen's diamond jubilee. ,13/04/2021 14:01
2107,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Finally, in remembering his service to Her Majesty, we do not forget that he was also a beloved husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. No matter what your role, no matter what your responsibility, grief spares no one, and in the most public of roles I do not imagine that having the space and time to grieve is easily granted.

You don't need to be a sailing expert or super fan to appreciate the skill, courage, innovation, and heart that this team has displayed throughout this regatta.",18/03/2021 14:01
2129,a,Grant Robertson,"I want to acknowledge the extraordinary group of people that make up Team New Zealand—in particular, Peter Burling, who has shown himself to be a world-class skipper with nerves of steel. On behalf of all New Zealand, I congratulate Peter, Grant Dalton, and the whole team—those on the water and those off it—for their tactical brilliance, determination, and sheer hard work. I would also like to acknowledge Luna Rossa, who put on a remarkable performance, especially given all of the constraints they have had to go through as a visiting team during COVID. Jimmy Spithill is a world-class sailor and a fierce competitor who it has been an honour to see sail in our waters. To all of the Luna Rossa syndicate and their fans, we thank them for being part of this regatta and putting up such a terrific challenge.",18/03/2021 14:01
2130,a,Grant Robertson,"Following a hard year, Team New Zealand has provided the country with huge optimism and excitement. To be able to show to the world that, in the midst of a pandemic, our country can host an event like this and have thousands gathered together on the Auckland waterfront to celebrate is something that we can be proud of as it was beamed around the world. In addition to this pride, there remains a strong economic spinoff and benefit to New Zealand from the America's Cup, even in COVID times. The facilities in the Wynyard Quarter, funded by the New Zealand Government and the Auckland Council, are a legacy that will be there for generations to come. This includes upgraded public spaces and access to the waterfront, additional berths for recreation and tourism, sheltered waterspace for existing and future water-based events, and long-term infrastructure for our marine industry. There is also an enormous amount of innovation and science that lies behind the success of Team New Zealand. At every level, we have seen technology used in a way that people never thought they would see in sailing, and that's happened right here in New Zealand, driving job creation and innovation.",18/03/2021 14:01
2131,a,Grant Robertson,"I want to acknowledge the partnership between Team New Zealand and mana whenua, Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei. They have worked closely together for some time, including gifting the name of Team New Zealand's yacht, Te Rehutai. This translates loosely to ""sea spray"", and it is in recognition of the power of the ocean to invigorate and energise our strength and our determination. Strength and determination is what we have seen from Team New Zealand during this regatta, and I want to express again the admiration of this Government and of this House to them for their work, and our pride in such an inspiring performance.",18/03/2021 14:01

2143,Speech,Speaker," Before I call the Leader of the House for his ministerial statement, for which notice has been given, I want to explain to the House how it will operate. The 2020 review of the Standing Orders recommended that members be able to engage in a short question and answer session with the Minister giving the statement. The intention of the Standing Orders Committee was that ministerial statements could operate in a similar way to the committee of the whole House, where members ask questions and Ministers answer them. So the Minister can make the statement, and then members may ask questions if they wish and/or make comments. I will allow an extended time, if necessary, for Ministers who ask questions. Ministers are required to address these questions but are not given carte blanche to make another speech. ",9/03/2021 14:01
2144,Speech,Chris Hipkins," Thank you, Mr Speaker. Since the House last met, Auckland has once again been through the arduous ordeal of a lockdown, and New Zealanders have been reminded of the need for continued vigilance in responding to COVID-19.",9/03/2021 14:02
2145,a,Chris Hipkins,"On Saturday, 27 February, a new case emerged which could not be immediately linked to the previous cases in the Auckland February cluster. We found ourselves in a position that was fairly clear-cut: there was no immediate link for the new case, and, even if there had been, a large number of exposure events associated with the latest case posed a significant risk of spread. This led Ministers to take the cautious approach which has served New Zealand so well through the pandemic and move Auckland to alert level 3 and the rest of New Zealand to alert level 2. Over the past week, our systems have once again been put to the test. I'm pleased to say that they have demonstrated their overall strength. ",9/03/2021 14:02
2146,a,Chris Hipkins,"By Friday afternoon, six days after identifying the new case, over 60,000 COVID-19 tests had been carried out—a significant proportion of those in Auckland—and 77 percent of the population of the Counties Manukau DHB have been tested. Our contact tracing team identified and managed roughly 6,000 contacts linked to the 15 cases. We were able to genomically link cases to give us confidence that we were dealing with a contained cluster, and we carried out regular wastewater testing at key sites, the results of which have all been negative, with the exception of the site near Jet Park, where we're currently quarantining people who have COVID-19, and we would expect to see positive results from that.",9/03/2021 14:02
2147,a,Chris Hipkins,"That's a massive credit to our testing teams and our contact tracing teams, and should provide the public with confidence that our systems are well placed to assist in the future if further cases were to arise. On the basis of this hard mahi and the fact that we found no new cases beyond household members, by Friday, Cabinet was confident to move Auckland to alert level 2 and the rest of New Zealand to alert level 1 from Sunday morning. We also agreed to meet again later this week, with a view to moving Auckland back to alert level 1 on Saturday if evidence suggests that it is safe to do so. This plan is consistent with our elimination strategy.",9/03/2021 14:02
2148,a,Chris Hipkins,"I am pleased to report the Government is also making good progress with the roll-out of our vaccine. Border workers and their household contacts are receiving their first doses of the Pfizer vaccine: a vaccine that is now a much greater reality for many more New Zealanders with the announcement we've secured an additional 8.5 million doses within our portfolio. While a vaccine does signal a promising light at the end of this very long tunnel, it remains vital that everyone continues to stringently follow the public health messages, which is continuing to keep your distance from people when out and about in public. And on public transport, if you can't maintain that distance of 2 metres, we encourage you to carry a facemask or face covering with you. If you are sick, stay at home—don't go to work or school and don't socialise. This protects you and it protects others. If you have symptoms of a cold or flu nature, if you've got aches or pains, call your doctor or Healthline and arrange to get a test. And please, to everybody, keep track of your movements at all times.",9/03/2021 14:02
2149,a,Chris Hipkins,"Moving down alert levels should not result in an increase in complacency. Indeed, with increased freedom comes increased responsibility—I know that our team of 5 million is up to that. We have the fourth lowest number of stay-at-home days of all OECD countries and the lowest average rating of OECD countries on the Oxford stringency index, meaning, on average, over the last year, we've had the fewest restrictions and the most freedoms of any country in the OECD. We all need to remain vigilant and to keep up that good work so that we can all continue to enjoy that.",9/03/2021 14:02
2150,Speech,Debbie Ngarewa-Packer," Kia ora, Mr Speaker. I'd like to speak to the ministerial statement in so much as two matters that came to Te Paati Māori's attention in the last week, and we've been very vocal about them. One was the communication that's been used. Clearly, the Government has changed strategy, but what we did see is that there hasn't been a change to the communications. And what we've seen is an effort to open schools very early, but it seems to forget that we're dealing with hundreds of rangatahi—many, we saw in the last week and a bit, whose first language is not English and whose first habit is not to listen to Government messaging. ",9/03/2021 14:32
2151,a,Debbie Ngarewa-Packer,"So what we've seen and become, I guess, quickly savvy with is a complex four-category framework that is being used by this Government. But what we didn't understand, again, is the mix of messaging that has, quite frankly, brought about a mounting mess of, ""Are we, aren't we, should we, shouldn't we?"" It resulted in what we saw in Te Ao Māori as a victim-blaming session in social media—intentionally or not. What we do want to do is ensure that the Minister for COVID-19 Response is aware of this and we stop, together, the backlash that we see that is happening to our communities. While we may be a team of 5 million, I think it's really important to remember that we have a small team and are relying on 400,000 South Aucklanders to carry the brunt of a lot of the decisions that are coming out of this Whare.",9/03/2021 14:32
2152,a,Debbie Ngarewa-Packer,"So one of the questions, I guess, that we do want to know from the Minister is: what have we learnt and what is the communication style that we're going to take going forward? The second thing we would like to put to the Minister is: what are we doing, and what are your approaches, with Māori specifically, as you have addressed the vulnerability? We would hope that there is effort and, certainly, focus on our Māori vulnerabilities in those who choose to have vaccinations, and not, as we heard this afternoon, on a cricket team. I would love to hear, and we would like to hear, your response to some of these questions. And just finally, thank you, is: when will we see a schedule for Māori roll-out from the Minister? Thank you. ",9/03/2021 14:32
2153,Speech,Chris Hipkins," One of the things that the debrief that's happening at the moment—and that's happening at a number of levels: it will, obviously, happen at the Ministry of Health where they'll be looking at their own internal processes and what they can learn from that; and then the review panel that I announced today will also have the opportunity to have a good look at this—will look at is: should our systems and processes be different in a school setting? We've actually had some feedback from a number of school leaders, not necessarily involved in this outbreak, pointing out that when you're dealing with teenagers there are some close contacts they have that they don't wish to disclose to their parents, let alone a contact tracing team, and that that is something that we needed to factor in in thinking about how we deal with a potential outbreak in a school setting. So we'll certainly have a closer look at that and consider that.",9/03/2021 14:35
2154,a,Chris Hipkins,"Health engagement with iwi leaders is ongoing around the testing regime, making sure that Māori are tested appropriately and proportionately and are not under-represented in our testing system. So that engagement is ongoing. When it comes to vaccines, the member will see a bit more about this tomorrow when we release the sequencing framework, but we have absolutely been working very carefully through all of those issues, including who our most at-risk populations are. The member will also be aware that some of our Māori-Pacific population is quite strongly represented in the first cohort—the people who are working at the border—as well. So they and their whānau are already off to a reasonably strong start; we need to make sure that we maintain that right the way through the vaccine campaign.",9/03/2021 14:35
2155,Speech,Speaker," I have received letters from David Seymour and the Hon Judith Collins, seeking to debate under Standing Order 399 the Government's announcement on Saturday, 27 February, putting the Auckland region into alert level 3 and the rest of the country into alert level 2. This is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. However, the House has had the opportunity to question the Government following the ministerial statement made earlier in the House this afternoon. I do not think that an urgent debate is also warranted. ",9/03/2021 15:26
2156,Speech,Speaker," I would, however, like to advise the House of updated procedures for applying for an urgent debate. Speakers' ruling 198/4 requires that the written notice required under Standing Order 399 must be handed to a member of the Speaker's staff. In practice, most applications are emailed to my office. Notices that are emailed will be treated the same way as hand-delivered ones. Notices should be signed by the member making the application, but I will accept a notice sent from the member's email address, or sent from another parliamentary address if it contains a statement that the application was authorised by the member or by another member on their behalf. That aligns the practice for urgent debates with the practice for lodging questions or notices of motion. ",9/03/2021 15:26
2157,Speech,Speaker," I have also received a letter from Matt Doocey, seeking to debate under Standing Order 399 the release of the initial Mental Health and Wellbeing Commission report, Mā Te Rongo Ake. This is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. The release of a report may warrant an urgent debate, but this must be exceptional, especially where working through a report's recommendations will take some time. I refer the member to Speaker's ruling 208/6. Now, the release of this initial report does not warrant the setting aside of the business of the House today. The application is declined. ",9/03/2021 15:27
2158,Speech,Chris Hipkins," I move, That this House approve the following orders made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020:",9/03/2021 15:28
2159,a,Chris Hipkins,"The motion that I have just mentioned confirms four orders that I have made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020, a brief comment on the process that has led us to this point first, and then I'll go through the specific orders. Under the rules set by the House, my ability to issue an order under the Act is subject to parliamentary scrutiny through the Regulations Review Committee. That is absolutely appropriate because the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 gives me, as the responsible Minister, quite considerable ability to issue orders, and there should be parliamentary scrutiny of those. ",9/03/2021 15:28
2160,a,Chris Hipkins,"The Act recognises that we need to make decisions quickly and we often need to amend those decisions quickly as we deal with an unprecedented global pandemic. It is still important, however, that those speedy decisions are the subject of scrutiny by the House, and I want to thank the Regulations Review Committee for the work that it has done in fulfilling that function. Three of the orders that we are confirming now have been inspected by the committee and they found no matters that they wished to bring to the attention of the House. Those are the amendments that have been made to the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border and Isolation and Quarantine) Amendment Order 2020—two lots of amendments there—and also to the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order (No 2) 2020. Those are relatively technical changes, reasonably straightforward, and have been well canvassed.",9/03/2021 15:28
2161,a,Chris Hipkins,"The order that the committee did want to raise an issue with, and I want to speak to the issues the committee raised, is the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) 2020. This is the order that I signed off on in January 2021 that provides for the new pre-departure testing requirement. Nobody, I think, objected to the pre-departure testing requirement. In fact, I think that was broadly supported across the House. What the Regulations Review Committee did, however, question was exactly how that pre-departure testing system was going to operate and, in particular, who would make decisions about who was covered by it and who was exempt. They've raised, I think, some quite legitimate issues that the Government will address. So, while we're confirming the order as made, I do want to accept the criticism made by the Regulations Review Committee and say that we are going to go about fixing that, to ensure that the anomalies that they have identified have been addressed. There are two ways that we'll do that, but first to what those anomalies are. ",9/03/2021 15:28
2162,a,Chris Hipkins,"This amendment order established the requirement for people before travelling to New Zealand to get a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours prior to departure. I delegated, through the order to the director-general, the power to gazette the countries to whom the pre-departure testing would apply. Initially, we imposed that requirement on travellers coming from the US or the UK, with a note in the decision that the reason for doing that was because of the significant outbreaks of COVID-19 that they were experiencing, and particular concern around the more highly transmissible variant emerging in the UK. Allowing the director-general to gazette which countries it applied to allowed us to add countries as risk was identified. The reality now is that, within a short space of time, the presumption there reversed: where we extended that requirement to all the countries unless there was an exemption, and then subsequently issued an exemption to that. ",9/03/2021 15:28
2163,a,Chris Hipkins,"The reason the Regulations Review Committee raised a concern was that the COVID19 Public Health Response Act 2020 specifically allows the director-general to exempt people from requirements. The Regulations Review Committee was concerned that allowing the director-general to decide who was covered by requirements was an unusual or unexpected use of the delegation ability within the Act. I think that that's a legitimate point; so we will amend the order to make it clear that it applies to everyone, unless people are exempted. So we will make that as a further amendment to the order, and then that will then be subject to Regulations Review Committee scrutiny again. That will get around the issue that they have raised. However, it does raise a wider issue that the Parliament will have an opportunity to consider when we next consider amendments to the Act itself, and that is whether or not the director-general should be empowered to be able to include people within the scope of an order, rather than just exempt them from the scope of an order. That's particularly, I think, relevant when we're talking about quite operational decisions. It is an anomaly, I think, in the Act.",9/03/2021 15:28
2164,a,Chris Hipkins,"The Act itself was passed through Parliament during an emergency situation where we had to put a legal framework in place very quickly, and so we now know a little bit more about how that Act can be improved. I intend to bring forward several sets of amendments to the Act. The first, which will come through in the next few months, will be the easier changes to improve the Act that have been identified. A second, later in the year, will deal with some of the bigger policy issues that have been raised. Obviously, one of the reasons for doing this is I want the Act to be as complete as possible. Also, I think it's important that the Act, which is likely to be used as a template should we ever have to do this again in the future, is as up to date and reflective of practice as possible. So we'll bring further amendments to the Act forward in the future. ",9/03/2021 15:28
2165,a,Chris Hipkins,"But, ultimately, these are all sensible decisions—I think; I made them—being approved by the House that are an integral part of our overall COVID-19 response. They largely relate to movement around the border and making sure that our rules there are as clear as possible. So most of the amendments we're dealing with here are amendments of clarification, and then, also, the most substantive additional amendment we're making is the implementation of pre-departure testing, which, as I said, I think everybody, by and large, supports, but there has been a technical issue about how that was implemented that we are working to resolve.",9/03/2021 15:28
2166,Speech,Deputy Speaker, The question is that the motion be agreed to. ,9/03/2021 15:35

2174,a,Jenny Salesa,"Submissions were called for, and a total of 38 submissions were received from a mixture of individuals and organisations, many of them NGOs, and the committee heard from 26 of these submitters. The committee submitted its final report to the then Minister of Foreign Affairs in August of last year. I would like, at this time, to thank the previous members of this committee from the 52nd Parliament, as well as the clerks and the officers that helped us with this inquiry. ",25/02/2021 15:02
2175,a,Jenny Salesa,"The inquiry focused on nine main themes, primarily focused on how Aotearoa New Zealand can increase its effectiveness in its aid programme to the Pacific. Can I also say at this time that over the last three years, there has been a significant increase that New Zealand has made in terms of aid to the Pacific Islands. Throughout the course of the inquiry, our committee expressed strong cross-party support and trust in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), who are delivering our aid in the Pacific. I would like, at this time, to thank both our MFAT staff here in Aotearoa New Zealand as well as our MFAT staff right across the Pacific for delivering our aid programme in the Pacific. I would also like to acknowledge all of the individuals and the organisations who took the time not only to write their submissions for our select committee but, as well as that, the 26 who came to present to our committee in person. They really assisted our committee in its inquiry and deliberations. ",25/02/2021 15:02
2176,a,Jenny Salesa,"In 2018, our previous Labour coalition Government announced the Pacific Reset, which was led at the time by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. That Pacific Reset was our golden opportunity to re-examine our relationship with our Pacific neighbours. The reset enabled an all-of-Government approach on our side. Aid to the Pacific is now no longer seen as the sole responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and more of our Government departments are now involved. This needs to continue, and our committee thinks that it should be expanded. This is evidenced by the submissions that we received—that there is considerable will to build stronger and more effective and enduring partnerships with our Pacific neighbours. ",25/02/2021 15:02
2177,a,Jenny Salesa,"I also would like to acknowledge that in terms of relationships with our Pacific countries, it is also really encouraging to know that the leadership from Aotearoa New Zealand is really strong. If I can begin from the top, what is well-known is the fact that our Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon Nanaia Mahuta, is tangata whenua. What may not be as well-known is the fact that our Minister of Foreign Affairs whakapapas to the Cook Islands. In fact, she has made many trips to the Cook Islands, and her own working relationships with the islands of the Cook Islands is something that I believe really would help to strengthen our working relationship with Aotearoa New Zealand. In addition to that, our Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs, who is in the House this afternoon, the Hon Aupito Su'a William Sio, is from Samoa. I don't know of any other time in the past where you have the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs with such strong ties to the Pacific, and that is something that we should celebrate.",25/02/2021 15:02
2178,a,Jenny Salesa,"In making recommendations, one of the main recommendations that our inquiry and our committee agreed with is that we should not only look at continuing to invest in the Pacific through our aid programme but that we should look at continuing to increase that investment through the official development assistance (ODA) to the Pacific. In making that recommendation, the committee intended to reflect the depth of New Zealand's commitment to working closely with our Pacific partners, as well as to signal the recognition that we are indeed part of the Pacific whānau; Aotearoa, after all, is very much part of Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa, the vast ocean we call Pacific. ",25/02/2021 15:02
2179,a,Jenny Salesa,"In that vein, can I also acknowledge that here in this House of Parliament we have 10 members of our Government's MPs who hail from the Pacific. In addition to that, we also have a member of the Green Party who also comes from the Pacific. I'm also pleased to see that many of the submitters that came to the inquiry recognised the strong ties that we have with the Pacific. ",25/02/2021 15:02
2180,a,Jenny Salesa,"There is a lot of investment, through the ODA, through MFAT, that we make out in the Pacific: investments in tourism, investment in education, and export enhancement measures, among others. I would like, at this time, though, to reflect on some of the other investments that we make in terms of MFAT. One of those is via Habitat for Humanity. What you may know is when the strongest cyclone hit Fiji, Cyclone Winston—it was graded at number five, actually. It was the strongest cyclone that we have experienced out in the Pacific. But when that cyclone hit, what MFAT had done, through partnership with Habitat for Humanity, is they had, over a number of years, built cyclone-resilient houses in Fiji. After that cyclone hit, only one of the houses that was built under the cyclone-resilient programme was affected in terms of the roof being taken off. That is something that MFAT has then looked at, that particular programme—expanded that particular initiative to the Kingdom of Tonga, because, as you know, cyclones hit right throughout the Pacific. So we also have MFAT building some cyclone-resilient houses in Tonga. ",25/02/2021 15:02
2181,a,Jenny Salesa,"If I can just mention at this time, some of the main themes coming through this inquiry are these: that we need to, in the future, partner for resilience in the Pacific; another important theme is that we need to, through our aid programme to the Pacific, ensure that as New Zealand delivers COVID-19 response, it is climate resilient. This is one of the reasons why I highlighted that investment that we already have with Habitat for Humanity, because we are already doing that work in Fiji as well as in Tonga. What our inquiry, of course, recommends is that we continue to do a whole lot more of that.",25/02/2021 15:02
2182,a,Jenny Salesa,"The report also recommends that New Zealand promotes empowerment, inclusion, and local ownership for our Pacific whānau. On this note, I want to reflect on one such empowerment and inclusion programme that MFAT is already investing in. This is led by Jonathan Kings from MFAT in Tonga. One of the things that the investment New Zealand makes in Tonga is this New Zealand standard training for men and women in Tonga that they receive so that they are lines men and lines women for when you're actually building powerlines. The initial thought that New Zealand had was that in training Tongans and Tongan women to be their own lines people, they can actually build up their own lines in terms of power—this is actually, again, as an after-effect of a cyclone. However, what has happened is Northpower, one of the companies that New Zealand actually partners with, is now attracting some of those people. Some of those men and some of those lines women are now being attracted to come and be lines men and lines women here in Aotearoa New Zealand. ",25/02/2021 15:02
2183,a,Jenny Salesa,So I do want to reflect on the fact that this aid to the Pacific is good for the Pacific; it is also good for New Zealand. May I commend the inquiry report on New Zealand's aid to the Pacific to the House. Fa'afetai.,25/02/2021 15:02
2184,Speech,Speaker," Order! [Interruption] Order! Pursuant to agreement this morning by leave, the House has now resumed. Before we move on to oral questions, I want to make a ruling with regard to points of order.",24/02/2021 14:00
2185,a,Speaker,"A point of order is a means of raising with the Chair a matter related to the order of the House. It may only be used to call attention to a breach of the rules of the House—Speaker's ruling 21/5—or to draw attention to the fact that a member intends to exercise a right given by the Standing Orders—Speaker's ruling 21/4. It is not a means to clarify matters, to seek guidance, to ask questions, or to dispute a ruling given by a presiding officer—Speakers' rulings 20/7 and 21/1.",24/02/2021 14:00
2186,a,Speaker,"Once a point of order has been decided, comment on it is not allowed—Speaker's ruling 23/4, reinforced by Speakers Wall and Carter, who have ruled previously that a decision by the Chair is final, and any attempt to subvert it or to bring it into question is out of order. To continue to do so is highly disorderly—Speakers' ruling 23/5. The only way to challenge a ruling in the committee of the whole House is to move to recall the Speaker—Speakers' ruling 76/3. I would note that in committee, the Chairperson is the sole judge of questions of relevancy, of scope, or of repetition. I will not reverse or interfere with a Chairperson's ruling on any of these matters in Speakers' ruling 77/1, and that is in keeping with the practice of Speakers going back 110 years in this Parliament. So I want to reinforce: matters of judgment are matters for the Chair at the time.",24/02/2021 14:00
2187,a,Speaker,"If a member wishes to seek clarification, if they do not understand a ruling, they should make an appointment with the presiding officer outside the House to discuss it.",24/02/2021 14:00
2188,Speech,Chris Bishop, I seek leave for members' notice of motion No. 1 in my name to be set down for debate forthwith.,24/02/2021 14:57
2189,Speech,Speaker, Is there any objection to that course? There is. I declare the House in committee for further consideration of the Local Electoral (Māori Wards and Māori Constituencies) Amendment Bill.,24/02/2021 14:57
2190,Speech,Jacinda Ardern, I seek leave to move a motion on the 10th anniversary of the Christchurch earthquake.,23/02/2021 14:00
2191,Interjection,Speaker, Leave is sought for that course of action. Is there any objection? There is none.,23/02/2021 14:00
2192,ContinueSpeech,Jacinda Ardern," I move, That this House mark the 10th anniversary of the devastating earthquake of 22 February 2011 that saw the tragic loss of 185 lives and thousands more injured, and acknowledge the people of Christchurch and the wider region who'll face the long-term impact of the earthquake.",23/02/2021 14:00
2193,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Along with many others in this House, I spent yesterday in Christchurch. It was humbling to be amongst people who have been through so much. The earthquake and aftershocks affected people in complex and diverse ways, and those impacts are still felt acutely 10 years on. To hear the names of the 185 people who lost their lives read aloud was a stark reminder that 22 February remains one of New Zealand's deadliest disasters. For some of those who lost loved ones, the last decade represents a period of grief, but also of healing. But for others, those 10 years simply signify 10 birthdays, 10 Christmases, 10 years of special moments without the one they loved. The message yesterday to everyone affected was clear: New Zealand will stand with you for as long as you need us to. ",23/02/2021 14:00
2194,a,Jacinda Ardern,"The earthquake shook Christchurch and the region and changed that city for ever, but it also impacted New Zealand. I remember so clearly how the country threw its support behind Canterbury in the months and years following the quake: raising funds, holding tributes, downing tools for moments of silence. Everyone felt so keenly the enormity of what had happened. The enormity has not lessened with the passage of time. ",23/02/2021 14:00
2195,a,Jacinda Ardern,"I'd like to acknowledge in this House, as I did yesterday, all those who were part of relief efforts on or after 22 February: emergency service staff, the Christchurch mayor—who remains in our thoughts—and city councillors, Ministers, international diplomats, and family and friends of all involved. I know we would all wish to acknowledge past and present members of the Quake Families Trust, and, as I did yesterday, I also want to acknowledge the children who lived through the earthquake. This was a cohort left particularly vulnerable, who would always grow up in the shadow of that day. We have all worked hard to support them—we had a duty to. In particular, over the last three years, alongside professionals in Canterbury, we created a programme to support the school children in the region who were affected by the earthquakes. We did the same in Kaikōura. That programme so far has helped 4,196 tamariki and will now roll out across New Zealand. Out of such a traumatic time for our kids has grown something positive for a whole generation. They have left a legacy. But I hope that no matter where they are or what age they are now, they continue to find and have the support they need.",23/02/2021 14:00
2196,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Finally, I'd like to acknowledge all New Zealand politicians—local council chambers, or here in this House—who have worked so hard to support Christchurch over the past 10 years. It has been uncharted territory, and everyone—on both sides of this House—did their very best for the city that they loved. ",23/02/2021 14:00
2197,a,Jacinda Ardern,"It's been a difficult decade for Christchurch. It's taken hits on so many fronts, but as we look forward to the coming decade, I see hope and I see optimism. We see a city emerging, one founded on innovation, ideas, and creativity. There's a focus on things that matter: people and communities. There are some amazing people in Christchurch doing amazing things. So please, keep going. We are with you.",23/02/2021 14:00

This is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. The matter is an important one that warrants the immediate attention of the House. Therefore, I call on David Seymour to move that the House takes note of a matter of urgent public importance.",16/02/2021 14:52
2201,Speech,Speaker," Members, I've noted that one member in particular has, notwithstanding the ruling that has been circulated to members, decided to enter the House without a tie. This matter was a subject of consultation with members. My own personal view has been expressed widely that I think ties are outdated, but that was not the view of the overwhelming majority of members who expressed their view to me. I'm therefore going to indicate to the leader of Te Paati Māori that I will not be calling him while he is not wearing a tie and he is not to enter the House again not wearing a tie.",9/02/2021 14:08
2202,Speech,Rawiri Waititi," I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. In an email you sent to the members of this House you did advise that business attire—and what I'm wearing is Māori business attire and a Māori tie; I stand here before you today in that manner. The second part of your email also talked about how a 2017 review of the Standing Orders supported members dressing in formal wear of the cultures they identify with. So that's why I stand here with this Standing Order at this particular time, Mr Speaker.",9/02/2021 14:09

2205,Speech,Chris Hipkins," Point of order, Mr Speaker. Speaker's ruling 18/7, made by Speaker Jack back in 1970 and endorsed by Assistant Speaker Tisch in 2015, states that the one and only proper form of attack against the Speaker, the presiding officer, is a notice of motion in the House. The member has not put a notice of motion on the Order Paper. Therefore, other members in the House cannot consider the merits of that, because it has not yet been published.",9/02/2021 14:55
2206,Interjection,Chris Bishop, Speaking to the point of order.,9/02/2021 14:55
2207,Speech,Speaker," No, I don't need assistance on that particular point. The House is actually the master of its own business in this matter, as with some others, and if the House chooses, by giving leave, to proceed in the way that the member is requesting, it may. Is there any objection to that course of action? There is objection.",9/02/2021 14:56

2212,a,Nanaia Mahuta,"A year has passed since this dark day and we continue to share aroha with all those impacted. Just after 2 p.m. on 9 December 2019—one year ago—Whakaari / White Island erupted. In the hours and days that followed, the enormity of the tragedy became apparent. Forty-seven people were on the island when it erupted, 22 lives were lost, and survivors were severely injured.",9/12/2020 14:00
2213,a,Nanaia Mahuta,"The impacts of this eruption were felt far beyond our shores. Many of those on the islands were visitors from Australia, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, and Malaysia.

2225,Intervention,Speaker," No, and it's getting to the point with a number of members where they raise spurious points of order on matters which are not matters of my responsibility as the Speaker, as opposed to the chair of the Parliamentary Service Commission. They are quite different roles, and the member knows that.",9/12/2020 14:13
2226,Speech,David Seymour," Well, I can assure you that this is in relation to your responsibility. I think the House would like an explanation, and I urge you to reconsider, because there are a range of matters that people would like to understand. You hold yourself out as a Speaker who campaigns against bullying and harassment. There are serious concerns raised in the media. I think you owe it to the House—regardless of any private agreement you may have in any capacity—to give an explanation of why you chose to release this information while the country was embroiled in digesting the royal commission of inquiry, of whether—",9/12/2020 14:13

2233,Intervention,Speaker," Yes, well, what ""no"" means goes right to the core of this matter, as the member is aware. I don't know if he's playing with words. I want to make absolutely clear that the detail, as outlined by Mr Bridges, is not in the code of conduct.",9/12/2020 14:15

I want to thank the Clerk of the House and all of the staff who look after us both here in the Chamber and in the other work that we do. I particularly want to acknowledge all Parliamentary Service staff: our security, the messengers, our select committee staff, the cleaners, our Hansard staff, and the Parliamentary Library, who counted my questions today. I want to give a special thanks—a personal thanks—to the staff of Bellamy's and ICON and hope not to see them as often in the coming months. I want to pay tribute today, particularly, to those who guide the school groups around our Parliament. This is something that is a really special moment for many young people to come here, and they do the most tremendous job of opening up the mysteries of this place, and so I thank all of them and our tour guides as well, and all of the staff in the offices here in Parliament, ministerial and parliamentary offices, and especially our staff in our outside-of-Parliament offices, who do the most incredible job for all members across the House in terms of supporting the people in our community. ",9/12/2020 14:54
2249,a,Grant Robertson (Deputy Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"I want to pay a special tribute to the VIP drivers who those of us who are Ministers rely on so much to get us from A to B and look after us along the way. I want to acknowledge the press gallery. Have a break! Seriously, take as long as you want. I want to acknowledge the friends and family—that means I'm still coming this evening, though, so yeah. I want to acknowledge the friends and family of members. We've heard so much in the recent maiden speeches about the importance of family and the sacrifices that they make. It keeps making me and the Prime Minister cry whenever members do that, but I think what that shows is just how important it is for us to acknowledge the role that our families play.

2250,a,Grant Robertson (Deputy Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"At this time of the year, it is also hard for those who have lost family, and my mind turns today to those who have lost their nearest and dearest, in particular the 25 New Zealanders who died from COVID-19 and those who passed in the mosque terrorist attacks and at Whakaari / White Island. With respect to the last two, the report of the royal commission and the first anniversary, respectively, will be drawing huge emotion forward. I want to reaffirm our desire to wrap our aroha around all of those who have been affected by these tragedies and attacks and work together to live up to New Zealand's reputation of inclusion and support, but make sure that we make that real.",9/12/2020 14:54
2251,a,Grant Robertson (Deputy Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"My final word of thanks today is to a group of workers whose title has been used more this year than in any year before: our essential workers. In June, when we first emerged into alert level 1, I stood on the side of the first Super Rugby Aotearoa game—notably won by the Highlanders over the Chiefs; she's not here today—and had the job of thanking our essential workers. And as I looked at the firefighters and the ambulance officers, the checkout operators, the security guards, the police, the doctors, the nurses, and more who were assembled, I felt humbled. Our team of 5 million has been extraordinary this year, and none more so than those who kept us safe and fed and well during those uncertain times. I continue to hope that one of the legacies of COVID-19 will be a greater appreciation of the roles that these workers play, especially the lower-paid workers among them. It is why I am so proud of a Labour Government that has lifted the minimum wage, is paying the living wage to our workers and to more and more of those who contract to us, and is going to double sick leave. We will not forget how hard-working our essential service workers are.",9/12/2020 14:54
2252,a,Grant Robertson (Deputy Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"As I prepared for this adjournment speech today, something strange, almost mystical, occurred. A gift arrived unannounced, wrapped in a kimono with a ham and cheese panini and a bowl latte on the side. I was provided with a list. My sixth sense told me it was indeed what I thought it was: newly minted real estate agent Paula Bennett's listings for December 2020. Now, as you would expect in the portfolio of a budding real estate agent, there are a mixture of those wanting to sell and those wanting to buy. One large sale stood out: the Blue family are looking to downsize—dramatically. The blurb for the Blue family's house says, ""After having one careful owner for nine years and then a series of bad short-term tenants, the Blue family house is a renovator's dream. Tired, with a bland colour scheme, and desperately in need of repiling and rewiring to come into the 21st century."" Paula Bennett has scribbled a note on this listing to say a recently arrived tenant has flown in saying he may want to make an offer fairly early in the new year—watch this space, Mr Speaker.",9/12/2020 14:54
2253,a,Grant Robertson (Deputy Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"There are, of course, always other purchasers in the market. Paula's listings include the Yellow and Pink family of 10, who are seeking a place after their bachelor pad has been outgrown. There are some very specific requirements, including 10 individual rooms, some of which have to be outfitted for people with giant chips on their shoulders. They also need a dance studio, and the house needs off-street parking for a speedboat. The Green family are also on Paula Bennett's list. They are seeking a communal living space, also for 10. It needs to be close to public transport routes. In fact, ideally on a public transport route—literally, they want it on a cycleway. The Red, White, and Black whānau are also looking for a new whare. It requires a large walk-in wardrobe with space for a number of hats, but no tie rack is required. And then there is the Red family. Now, they are seeking a much, much bigger house after the arrival of a number of unexpected members. ",9/12/2020 14:54
2254,a,Grant Robertson (Deputy Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"I want to pay tribute to the Labour team. As you will have seen from the maiden speeches so far, those who are joining us are adding exceptional qualities to an already exceptional team. This has been a huge and difficult year, but the dedication, commitment, support, and discipline of the Labour team has been extraordinary. In a year like no other, this team has delivered, and I am so proud of them. The Labour team understands the mandate that we have been given. We are humbled by it, and we know that every day we must work hard to maintain the trust of those who have supported us and, indeed, of every New Zealander.",9/12/2020 14:54

Every New Zealander, as they reflect on this tough 2020, can stand proud that they have been part of putting a country in a position so that today we stand here as one of the most open countries in the world with an economy that is recovering. That is the work of every single New Zealander, and we should all be very proud about that.",9/12/2020 14:54
2256,a,Grant Robertson (Deputy Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"From the Government's point of view, faced with the most dramatic health and economic crises of our lifetime, our Government has responded with speed, compassion, and pragmatism. I want to acknowledge the role of the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern, in her leadership of that. Witnessing that up close, I know that the life and death decisions weighed heavily on our Prime Minister, but at every step of the way she has kept her values strong. She has listened to evidence, she has listened to science, and I believe she has led New Zealand through one of our most difficult times with extraordinary skill and talent.",9/12/2020 14:54
2257,a,Grant Robertson (Deputy Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"As we now look towards the end of 2020—and we are all looking forward to putting a line through it—and going into 2021, this Government is clear about what our priorities are. We must continue to keep New Zealanders safe. It is the message delivered in this election that New Zealanders want continuity and stability and certainty with making sure that we keep COVID-19 out and we keep our people safe during this period of time. But we must also now continue to accelerate and build on the economic recovery that we have. The 1.7 million New Zealanders who we supported through the wage subsidy scheme, many of whom are still in work, need our support, but so do those who lost work and lost jobs, and we have to recognise that for many families this year will be difficult. ",9/12/2020 14:54
2258,a,Grant Robertson (Deputy Prime Minister) On Behalf Of The Leader Of The House,"Our commitment as a Labour Government is to work alongside all of those people to create jobs, to support them and their families through this difficult time. And yes, we will also address those longstanding issues around housing, around climate change, and around child poverty. We know, on this side of the House, that New Zealanders have high expectations of us. We will take this time over summer to recharge and return in 2021 to deliver on that agenda of keeping New Zealanders safe, accelerating our recovery, and building the foundations for a future that every New Zealander is part of. Merry Christmas, Mr Speaker. ",9/12/2020 14:54
2259,Speech,Chris Hipkins," I move, That the following rules be adopted:",8/12/2020 19:15
2260,a,Chris Hipkins,Disallowance or amendment of COVID-19 order ,8/12/2020 19:15
2261,a,Chris Hipkins,"This rule applies to a notice of motion to disallow or amend a COVID-19 order only if that notice of motion is given by a member who, at the time the notice of motion is given, is a member of the Regulations Review Committee.",8/12/2020 19:15
2262,a,Chris Hipkins,Select committee reports set down ,8/12/2020 19:15
2263,a,Chris Hipkins,A select committee report on a notice of motion under rule 2 or 4 is set down for consideration with that notice of motion.,8/12/2020 19:15
2264,a,Chris Hipkins,"This motion puts in place a series of rules regarding how we are going to be dealing with COVID-19 Public Health Response Act orders in future in this term of Parliament, and it mirrors one that was put in place in the last Parliament. The regulations review process that we have in this Parliament is a very good one. Those members who have sat in this House who have sat on the Regulations Review Committee will acknowledge that it's actually a very thorough process, and it is one that brings some accountability to the making of rules that has been delegated by this House to a member of the executive through an Order in Council. But it does not move quickly, and, with regard to the orders that are issued under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act, we do need to have a mechanism that moves a little bit more quickly than that. So this Sessional Order that we are putting in place means that each order that's made under the Act will be reviewed by the Regulations Review Committee by the later of six sitting days or 16 working days after it is presented to the House, and the House would not be able to approve an order made before the Regulations Review Committee has reported on it.",8/12/2020 19:15
2265,a,Chris Hipkins,"An accelerated disallowance and amendment procedure is also put in place by the Sessional Order. That's really important because, if orders are not confirmed by the House, they ultimately expire, and in the next motion that I'll be bringing before the House, I'll talk a little bit about the orders that we have made under this. I think members across the House would find it difficult to disagree with any of the orders that have been issued under the Act to date, and, in fact, some would probably argue that some of the orders should have gone further than they did. In fact, I think the contribution from Mr Bishop where he said that he opposed the ability for the Government to make the orders but didn't think the orders had gone far enough illustrated that very point. But I do note that the Regulations Review Committee has members from the four biggest parties in the House. It does not have a majority of Labour members, and I do point out that any member of the Regulations Review Committee can in fact move the disallowance of a regulation made. So it is important that that process continues with the integrity that, I think, it has developed over the time that that committee has been in place.",8/12/2020 19:15
2266,a,Chris Hipkins,"The other thing that this motion, this set of rules, does is put in place a new mechanism to deal with any further continuance of the Act. I want to thank David Seymour for his constructive comments. One of the reasons that we have not continued the Act for a longer period of time is that I do believe that Parliament should have the opportunities to do exactly what David Seymour has suggested the ACT Party will do, which is to monitor the implementation and the use of the Act, and if Parliament as a whole feels that Government has gone too far, Parliament should have the ability to do something about that. So we have now just extended the Act until April. Under these rules, Parliament will then have to consider a motion to extend it through a select committee process, and we will then have to come back and we'll have to have another debate in the House, where members will be able to do what David Seymour just did, and say whether or not they feel that we are using our powers in the Act appropriately. I don't think that we should extend—even when we do it next time—the Act for a very, very long period of time, given that things can move quickly in the COVID world and, at some point, I think, we all hope we will be at the point where we can let the Act lapse because the risk will have gone and we can then start to revert back to normal.",8/12/2020 19:15
2267,a,Chris Hipkins,"Parliament, at that point, will need to turn its attention to what should happen with future pandemics, because I think we've discovered that our epidemic response legislation isn't as good and as useful as it needs to be, and we do need to think about some enduring arrangements. They may be modelled on this; they may not be. But I think it is important that, while these extraordinary powers are in place, Parliament has the opportunity to check back in on them regularly. The procedures that we're putting in place through this motion that I have put forward allow us to do that.",8/12/2020 19:15

2270,a,Chris Hipkins,"I don't think there'll be many on the edge of their seats at home listening to this one, but this committee is an important committee. In addition to the members that I have just mentioned, the Speaker, the Leader of the House, and the Leader of the Opposition or a nominee—in this case, I understand, Mr Bishop—are automatically members of the Parliamentary Service Commission. The Parliamentary Service Commission does have an important role in the running of the Parliament. It provides political advice on the oversight and administration of the parliamentary complex to the Speaker—that advice is sometimes taken. The committee does meet regularly. I think it is an important part of our parliamentary arrangements, and so I commend this motion to the House.",8/12/2020 19:37

2312,a,Chris Hipkins,"Very briefly, by way of introduction, the Intelligence and Security Committee is created by the Intelligence and Security Act of 2017. It sits alongside other select committees that the House itself creates, but at the start of every new Parliament we put in place this set of rules that enables the Intelligence and Security Committee to do the sorts of things that select committees do, including scrutiny of bills, hearing of petitions, Estimates, and carrying out the annual reviews. This motion is identical to the one that was put in place at the beginning of the last Parliament, with one notable exception: that it regards members attending one of these meetings, the Intelligence and Security Committee meetings, as being present for parliamentary purposes even if the meeting is being held offsite. One of the things that we have to acknowledge about this particular committee is it will, on occasion, meet in a secure location, and those members who are attending those meetings also need to be deemed to be present for parliamentary purposes. Other than that, these are the same rules that applied in the last term of the Parliament.",8/12/2020 19:39
2313,Speech,Assistant Speaker, The question is that the motion be agreed to.,8/12/2020 19:40
2314,Speech,Jacinda Ardern," I move, That this House: ",2/12/2020 14:51
2315,a,Jacinda Ardern,"I think the first and most important point to make is that this is a declaration based on science. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the pre-eminent scientific body in the world on this matter, has determined that in order to avoid a disastrous 1.5 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures and beyond—a rise that would see increased risk to human health and livelihood, civil unrest, mass drought, disease, loss of lands and homes, increased fires, increased tropical storms, mass human displacement, and globally exhausted resources—we must act with urgency to ensure global emissions fall to net zero by 2050. ",2/12/2020 14:51
2316,a,Jacinda Ardern,"This is a declaration grounded in a deep sense of responsibility—responsibility that we all must feel, but particularly given that we, as New Zealanders, are members of the Pacific. In 2019, I visited Tokelau, a rare privilege. A population of only 1,500, only accessible by boat—and so perhaps, therefore, their story is not often shared. But there I physically observed newly built coastal walls that were already toppling over from the assault by the sea. Those walls had been erected to prevent a seaside burial ground that had been there for many, many years from being inundated—to protect it against significant erosion. Those walls were already failing. ",2/12/2020 14:51
2317,a,Jacinda Ardern,"Tokelau is not alone. The Pacific Islands Forum has called climate change our greatest threat—their greatest threat—and that is why the goal to limit temperature rises to 1.5 degrees is embedded in our legislation. That's not something that every nation has done, but we have, because anything more than that means consigning the Pacific—it means consigning our region—to a devastating reality that if we are responsible members of the Pacific, we cannot and will not accept.",2/12/2020 14:51
2318,a,Jacinda Ardern,"This declaration is an acknowledgment of the next generation: an acknowledgment of the burden that they will carry if we do not get this right and if we do not take action now. When I visit schools, when I read children's letters, I'm often struck by how deeply personal the climate crisis is to them. We cannot underestimate a generation, full of angst and anxiety over the reality of climate change for them and their generation. And it is up to us to make sure that we demonstrate there is a pathway, there is a plan for action, and there is a reason for hope. For them, it is instinctual. It is tangible. It is real. It is about the country they will inherit and it's about the burden of debt they will inherit unless we make sure that we demonstrate leadership on this issue. ",2/12/2020 14:51
2319,a,Jacinda Ardern,"This declaration is about our global responsibilities. As a nation, it is not in our nature to turn our back on a problem, and it's certainly not in our DNA to ignore a sense of responsibility and obligation. On climate change we will only make progress if we absolutely accept that collective action is required. If any nation falls short, we all fall short. So, importantly, this is a declaration that records the formal importance of our intent as a nation and our intent on the global stage. It's a declaration that now serves as a directive to all aspects of the public service around the urgency that we as a Government require and the urgency that we require around action. It acts as a catalyst for change.",2/12/2020 14:51
2320,a,Jacinda Ardern,"It's a declaration that says we must get our own house in order. It serves as the clearest of signals to the private sector, and I acknowledge significant action has been taken by many in the private sector. Many are taking action now, demonstrating leadership. But to others, I say there is no more runway to push back on. Globally, we have entered an age of action, and that includes the private sector as well. ",2/12/2020 14:51
2321,a,Jacinda Ardern,"So, with action in mind, today, as a Government, we are also announcing the Carbon Neutral Government Programme that requires Government organisations to be carbon-neutral by 2025. We must get our own house in order. How can we stand and take a leadership position amongst the private sector unless we take the same action that we expect of them? It will require Government agencies to measure and reduce their emissions, and if they are unable to achieve carbon neutrality, they must offset. They will be required to develop emissions reduction targets and plans. They will be required to individually report to Parliament on their emissions. Ministers will be held accountable. And from 2025, as I've said, if they do not reach their own targets, they will be required to offset. This means they will have to act differently. They will have, also, a major financial incentive to do so. ",2/12/2020 14:51
2322,a,Jacinda Ardern,"There are three specific elements to our plan around a carbon-neutral Public Service. First, we will phase out the use of coal boilers in the State sector. We'll prioritise getting rid of the largest and most active boilers, using the $200 million State sector decarbonisation fund to replace them with clean alternatives. There are over 200 coal boilers still in the State sector; that needs to change. Secondly, we're requiring mandated Government agencies to only purchase electric vehicles (EVs) or hybrid vehicles. If electrics are not appropriate for their specific needs, then there is a specific operational requirement that they must go through in order to demonstrate why. We are also requiring them to optimise their fleet at the same time. The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority estimates that we can reduce the size of our fleet by up to 20 percent. We've also allocated $20 million from the State sector decarbonisation fund to co-fund the cost of EVs and charging infrastructure. We spent the better part of last term putting in place the infrastructure that would enable this transition to happen. Thirdly, we are putting in place an energy efficiency building standard on all mandated agencies who occupy office space over 2,000 square metres. ",2/12/2020 14:51
2323,a,Jacinda Ardern,"So let me be clear. This is a declaration that will need to be supported by ongoing, continual action and activity. It sits behind the work that we did in our first term of office: our plan to plant one billion trees; our ban on new offshore oil and gas exploration; our goal of 100 percent renewable electricity generation by 2030, and we are already under way investigating a scheme that would allow New Zealand to have, essentially, the battery that helps us overcome dry years to reach that 100 percent renewable goal; our record investment in rail, trains, buses, walking, and cycling, and now we are moving to decarbonise that public transport fleet, too; our $100 million Green Investment Fund; our world-first partnership with farmers to reduce primary sector emissions; and our intention to make action on climate change an integral part of our COVID recovery so that we don't only build back our economy, we build it back in a sustainable way with a focus on carbon neutrality. ",2/12/2020 14:51
2324,a,Jacinda Ardern,"We issue declarations sparingly. The reason we have done this today is that those cases where we do issue declarations are often where there are threats to life, threats to property, or civil defence emergencies. If we do not respond to climate change, we will continue to have those emergencies on our shore. I do want to acknowledge, as I conclude, the Minister of Climate Change and the Green Party, endless advocates for activity in this space that we will continue to work in partnership with. But I encourage every member of this House to take the issue of climate change with the utter seriousness that it deserves. Vote in favour of this declaration today. Be on the right side of history. Be part of the solution we must collectively deliver for the next generation.",2/12/2020 14:51

His grandparents Matiu and Iriaka Ratana were both MPs for Western Māori and he's the great-grandson of the Ratana founder, T W Ratana, and his mentor was Koro Wētere. He's a highly respected figure amongst Māoridom, and he has served this House well as Assistant Speaker during the last term of Parliament. He has proven to be a calm and fair but decisive and firm Assistant Speaker. Members have responded well to his approach to presiding over the House, and I'm sure that he will be an appointment that will be supported across the Chamber. ",26/11/2020 11:35
2328,Speech,Chris Bishop," Thank you, Mr Speaker. The National Opposition is pleased to support the nomination of Mr Rurawhe to be the Deputy Speaker. As the Leader of the House has noted, he is someone who brings huge mana and wisdom to the position. He's already served as a presiding officer in the last Parliament and discharged that important role with dignity and with decorum, and we welcomed his rulings as a presiding officer in the last Parliament. On a personal note, it's great to see a member of the class of 2014, the time I entered Parliament, assume the position of a presiding officer's role, and we look forward to his continued discharge of his duties.

The Abortion Supervisory Committee has been omitted on the basis that it no longer exists and the newly formed Te Pūkenga—New Zealand Institute of Skills and Technology has been added on the basis that it now exists. Other than that, this motion follows the same formula as the last time Parliament considered this matter, and it simply means that these organisations which otherwise wouldn't be subject to parliamentary scrutiny will be.",26/11/2020 11:59
2332,Speech,Speaker, The House is suspended until 2 p.m. today for the Address in Reply.,26/11/2020 12:00
2333,Speech,Speaker," It was my intention at this stage to call the Māori Party, but I think it is worth outlining to the House my response and some of the things which have led up to the situation we faced. The actual technical Standing Order issue that occurred earlier when I interrupted the speech from the co-leader of the Māori Party when he was attempting to move a motion is very simple: when there's a motion on the floor, you cannot get up and start moving another one. There are processes to go through, and that's very clear. ",26/11/2020 16:27
2334,a,Speaker,"There has been through this week an ongoing discussion around whether or not the co-leaders of the Māori Party could have two speeches each in the Address in Reply debate. It's been made clear that the current rules don't allow for that. It was a matter that was discussed at the Business Committee, and the offer was made to the Māori Party for each of the co-leaders to have 15-minute speeches, starting now, recognising both their maiden status and the fact that they are leaders of non-specified parties. That was the approach that was taken, I think, with David Seymour in 2014, so there's precedent and prior precedent for that. It's become clear that that was not acceptable, and, therefore, I presume that is the reason that the members walked out. ",26/11/2020 16:27
2335,a,Speaker,"I think it would be of value, because there is not long but some important correspondence around this matter, for me to seek leave to table the correspondence between the Clerk's Office, myself, and the co-leaders of the Māori Party on this issue. Is there any objection to that? There appears to be none. ",26/11/2020 16:27
2336,a,Speaker,"SPEAKER: There's one further matter that I want to refer to, and it was referred to, or alluded to, by the Hon James Shaw yesterday in his comments of congratulations to me. It goes to dress codes in the Parliament, which are set out on page 151 of McGee and also referred to in Speaker's ruling 17/7. The essence of the rules for dress in this Parliament is that they should be business attire, and while they've been expressed in different ways over the years—and, in fact, when I was first a member, the rules applied to male members of Parliament and not to women, because the earlier rules didn't anticipate the possibility of women being members of Parliament, even at the stage when I was first a member of Parliament. But they have been changed to this—to ""business attire"". ",26/11/2020 16:27
2337,a,Speaker,"In the 1980s, when I was first a member and before we had air conditioning in this Chamber, it was the practice for gentlemen to be allowed to remove their jackets when it was warm.
